"Comorbidities and COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admission and hospital mortality in Austria : A retrospective cohort study.","Rainer, Lukas; Bachner, Florian; Eglau, Karin; Ostermann, Herwig; Siebert, Uwe; Zuba, Martin","BACKGROUND: The protection of vulnerable populations is a central task in managing the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to avoid severe courses of COVID-19 and the risk of healthcare system capacity being exceeded. To identify factors of vulnerability in Austria, we assessed the impact of comorbidities on COVID-19 hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and hospital mortality., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed including all patients with COVID-19 in the period February 2020 to December 2021 who had a previous inpatient stay in the period 2015-2019 in Austria. All patients with COVID-19 were matched to population controls on age, sex, and healthcare region. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) of included factors with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., RESULTS: Hemiplegia or paraplegia constitutes the highest risk factor for hospitalization (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.44-1.79), followed by COPD (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.43-1.53) and diabetes without complications (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.37-1.46). The highest risk factors for ICU admission are renal diseases (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.61-1.92), diabetes without complications (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.46-1.69) and COPD (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.41-1.66). Hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease and COPD constitute the highest risk factors for hospital mortality, with ORs of 1.5. Diabetes without complications constitutes a significantly higher risk factor for women with respect to all three endpoints., CONCLUSION: We contribute to the literature by identifying sex-specific risk factors. In general, our results are consistent with the literature, particularly regarding diabetes as a risk factor for severe courses of COVID-19. Due to the observational nature of our data, caution is warranted regarding causal interpretation. Our results contribute to the protection of vulnerable populations and may be used for targeting further pharmaceutical interventions. Copyright © 2022.

Outcomes of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Canadian first wave epicentre: a retrospective cohort study.,"Melancon, Eve; Brosseau, Marc; Bartoli, Anthony; Labbe, Annie-Claude; Lavallee, Christian; Marchand-Senecal, Xavier; Wang, Han Ting","BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial number of Quebec hospitals were hit by hospital-acquired (HA) SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our objective was to assess whether mortality is higher in HA cases than in non-hospital-acquired (NHA) cases and determine the prevalence of HA-SARS-CoV-2 infection in our hospital., METHODS: This retrospective single-centre cohort study included all adults (>= 18 yr) who had COVID-19, admitted to Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont (Montreal, Canada) from Mar. 1 to June 30, 2020. We collected data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, treatment, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation requirements from electronic health records. We adjudicated hospital acquisition based on the timing of symptom onset, and polymerase chain reaction testing for and exposures to SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the association between HA-SARS-CoV-2 infection and in-hospital mortality, we computed a multivariable logistic regression analysis including known risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 as covariates., RESULTS: Among 697 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 253 (36.3%) were classified as HA. The mortality rate was higher in the HA group than in the NHA group (38.2% v. 26.4%, p = 0.001), while the rates of ICU admission (8.3% v. 19.1%, p = 0.001) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (3.6% v. 13.0%, p = 0.001) were lower. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that HA-SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients younger than 75 years is an independent risk factor for death (odds ratio 2.78, 95% confidence interval 1.44-5.38)., INTERPRETATION: Our results show that HA-SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger patients was associated with higher mortality. Future studies need to evaluate relevant patient-centred long-term outcomes in this population.

The follow-up censoring date was 17 April 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and complications data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death., RESULTS: Of the 4035 patients, male subjects accounted for 2433 (61.0%) of 3987, the median age was 70 years and 2539 (73.8%) of 3439 had one or more comorbidity. The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise and dyspnoea. During hospitalization, 1255 (31.5%) of 3979 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736 (18.5%) of 3988 were admitted to intensive care units and 619 (15.5%) of 3992 underwent mechanical ventilation. Virus- or host-targeted medications included lopinavir/ritonavir (2820/4005, 70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (2618/3995, 65.5%), interferon beta (1153/3950, 29.2%), corticosteroids (1109/3965, 28.0%) and tocilizumab (373/3951, 9.4%). Overall, 1131 (28%) of 4035 patients died. Mortality increased with age (85.6% occurring in older than 65 years). Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them including advanced age, liver cirrhosis, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide comprehensive information about characteristics and complications of severe COVID-19, and may help clinicians identify patients at a higher risk of death.

Outcomes of the 2019 novel coronavirus in patients with or without a history of cancer: A multi-centre North London experience,"N., Nalinie Joharatnam-Hogan; D., Daniel Hochhauser; K.-K., Shiu; H., Rush; V., Crolley; E., Butcher; A., Sharma; A., Muhammad; N., Vasdev; M., Anwar; G., Kantser; A., Saha; F., Raja; J., Bridgewater; , Khan K H","Background: The high prevalence and associated healthcare, social and economic challenges of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests this pandemic is likely to have a major impact on cancer management, and has been shown to potentially have worse outcomes in this cohort of vulnerable patients. This study aims to compare the outcomes of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Method(s): We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in 5 different North London hospitals (cohort A) and compared their outcomes to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients without a history of cancer (cohort B). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidty and treated during the same time period (1st March- 30th April 2020). Result(s): The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of 2 comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 (95% CI 0.4-2.5), and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4-2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68-23.95), p=0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer. Conclusion(s): Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. These data do not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts. If a second peak of pandemic strikes, a coordinated response of all overlapping specialities in the fight against cancer is required.

"Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity in patients with cancer in Wuhan, China: a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study","J., Tian; X., Yuan; J., Xiao; Q., Zhong; C., Yang; B., Liu; Y., Cai; Z., Lu; Y., Wang; S., Liu; B., Cheng; J., Wang; M., Zhang; L., Wang; S., Niu; Z., Yao; X., Deng; F., Zhou; W., Wei; Q., Li; X., Chen; W., Chen; Q., Yang; S., Wu; J., Fan; B., Shu; Z., Hu; S., Wang; X.-P., Yang; W., Liu; X., Miao; , Wang Z","Background: COVID-19 has spread globally. Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. Method(s): In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged >=18 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. Finding(s): Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13 077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22-38) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20-35) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 3.61 [95% CI 2.59-5.04]; p<0.0001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.05-6.43; p=0.039), elevated tumour necrosis factor alpha (1.22, 1.01-1.47; p=0.037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (1.65, 1.03-2.78; p=0.032), reduced CD4+ T cells (0.84, 0.71-0.98; p=0.031), and reduced albumin-globulin ratio (0.12, 0.02-0.77; p=0.024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. Interpretation(s): Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer. The risk factors identified here could be helpful for early clinical surveillance of disease progression in patients with cancer who present with COVID-19.

Covid-19 in patients with hematological and solid cancers at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Germany,"K., Shoumariyeh; F., Biavasco; G., Ihorst; S., Rieg; A., Nieters; W.V., Kern; C., Miething; J., Duyster; M., Engelhardt; Bertz H.  AO  - Shoumariyeh, Khalid; ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7969-1972","Background: Patients with cancer are considered a high-risk group for viral pneumonia, with an increased probability of fatal outcome. Here, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with solid and hematological cancers and concomitant Covid-19 at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in a Covid-19 hotspot area in Germany. Method(s): We performed a retrospective single center cohort study of 39 patients with hematological and solid cancers who were hospitalized at the University Hospital Freiburg for Covid-19. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models we compared time to severe events and overall survival to an age-matched control cohort of 39 patients with confirmed Covid-19 without a cancer diagnosis. Result(s): In the cancer cohort 29 patients had a diagnosis of a solid tumor, and 10 had a hematological malignancy. In total, eight patients (21%) in the cancer and 14 patients (36%) from the noncancer cohort died during the observation period. Presence of a malignancy was not significantly associated with survival or time to occurrence of severe events. Major influences on mortality were high IL-6 levels at Covid-19 diagnosis (HR = 6.95, P =.0121) and age >= 65 years (HR = 6.22, P =.0156). Conclusion(s): Compared to an age-matched noncancer cohort, we did not observe an association between a cancer diagnosis and a more severe disease course or higher fatality rate in patients with Covid-19. Patients with a hematological malignancy showed a trend towards a longer duration until clinical improvement and longer hospitalization time compared to patients with a solid cancer. Cancer per se does not seem to be a confounder for dismal outcome in Covid-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Characteristics and Outcomes of 35 Breast Cancer Patients Infected With COVID-19,"B., Zhang; R., Xie; S.M., Hubert; Y., Yu; Y., Zhang; X., Lei; W., Deng; J., Chen; , Li Y","Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly engulfed the world. Cancer patients infected with COVID-19 are considered to carry higher severity of the disease and higher mortality rate than common COVID-19 patients in previous studies. However, due to the poor clinical information on COVID-19 patients with cancer, the evidences that supported this conclusion are insufficient. At present, rather limited reports have analyzed the clinical data of breast cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Therefore, in this retrospective study, we described the clinical characteristics and the outcomes of 35 COVID-19 patients with breast cancer and compared 55 COVID-19 patients without cancer and 81 COVID-19 patients with other types of cancer as controls. Our data showed that there were no differences in disease severity and outcomes between the COVID-19 patients with breast cancer and the common COVID-19 patients, which was in contrast to previous studies. In addition, compared with other types of cancer patients, asymptomatic infections and mild cases among breast cancer patients made up a substantially larger proportion. Our results indicated that the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients were milder than those of other types of cancer patients, but there were no significant differences in outcomes between the two groups.© Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Xie, Hubert, Yu, Zhang, Lei, Deng, Chen and Li.",2020,//,Frontiers in Oncology,10,,570130-570130,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.570130,,#61478,B 2020,"",true cancer vs non-cancer
Impact of chronic liver disease upon admission on COVID-19 in-hospital mortality: Findings from COVOCA study,"R., Galiero; P.C., Pafundi; V., Simeon; L., Rinaldi; A., Perrella; E., Vetrano; A., Caturano; M., Alfano; D., Beccia; R., Nevola; R., Marfella; C., Sardu; C., Coppola; F., Scarano; P., Maggi; P., de Lucia Sposito; L., Vocciante; C., Rescigno; C., Sbreglia; F., Fraganza; R., Parrella; A., Romano; G., Calabria; B., Polverino; A., Pagano; C., Bologna; M., Amitrano; V., Esposito; N., Coppola; N., Maturo; L.E., Adinolfi; P., Chiodini; , Sasso F C","Background Italy has been the first Western country to be heavily affected by the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection and among the pioneers of the clinical management of pandemic. To improve the outcome, identification of patients at the highest risk seems mandatory. Objectives Aim of this study is to identify comorbidities and clinical conditions upon admission associated with in-hospital mortality in several COVID Centers in Campania Region (Italy). Methods COVOCA is a multicentre retrospective observational cohort study, which involved 18 COVID Centers throughout Campania Region, Italy. Data were collected from patients who completed their hospitalization between March-June 2020. The endpoint was in-hospital mortality, assessed either from data at discharge or death certificate, whilst all exposure variables were collected at hospital admission. Results Among 618 COVID-19 hospitalized patients included in the study, 143 in-hospital mortality events were recorded, with a cumulative incidence of about 23%. At multivariable logistic analysis, male sex (OR 2.63, 95%CI 1.42-4.90; p = 0.001), Chronic Liver Disease (OR 5.88, 95%CI 2.39-14.46; p<0.001) and malignancies (OR 2.62, 95%CI 1.21-5.68; p = 0.015) disclosed an independent association with a poor prognosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Respiratory Severity Scale allowed to identify at higher mortality risk. Sensitivity analysis further enhanced these findings. Conclusion Mortality of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 appears strongly affected by both clinical conditions on admission and comorbidities. Originally, we observed a very poor outcome in subjects with a chronic liver disease, alongside with an increase of hepatic damage.Copyright © 2020 Galiero et al.

Case fatality rate of cancer patients with COVID-19 in a New York Hospital system,"V., Mehta; S., Goel; R., Kabarriti; D., Cole; M., Goldfinger; A., Acuna-Villaorduna; K., Pradhan; R., Thota; S., Reissman; J.A., Sparano; B.A., Gartrell; R.V., Smith; N., Ohri; M., Garg; A.D., Racine; S., Kalnicki; R., Perez-Soler; B., Halmos; , Verma A","Patients with cancer are presumed to be at increased risk from COVID-19 infection-related fatality due to underlying malignancy, treatment-related immu-nosuppression, or increased comorbidities. A total of 218 COVID-19-positive patients from March 18, 2020, to April 8, 2020, with a malignant diagnosis were identified. A total of 61 (28%) patients with cancer died from COVID-19 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37% (20/54) for hematologic malignancies and 25% (41/164) for solid malignancies. Six of 11 (55%) patients with lung cancer died from COVID-19 disease. Increased mortality was significantly associated with older age, multiple comor-bidities, need for ICU support, and elevated levels of D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate in multivariate analysis. Age-adjusted CFRs in patients with cancer compared with noncancer patients at our institution and New York City reported a significant increase in case fatality for patients with can-cer. These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population.

Outcomes of covid-19 patients under cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy in brazil,"M.B.O., Duarte; F., Leal; J.L.P., Argenton; , Carvalheira J B C","Background: Cancer patients present a distinct vulnerability to COVID-19. It is unclear if chemotherapy could accentuate the overall risk in these patients. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis linking COVID-19 data and oncological information systems to compare lethality in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy before COVID-19. We considered patients who received chemotherapy in the last 30 days as in ""active treatment"", and patients who did not receive drugs in this period as ""non-active treatment"" for propensity-score pair matching. We also tested the influence of baseline variables in our results in a multivariate model. Result(s): 66.1% (162/246) of patients in matched active chemotherapy died vs. 70.2% (172/246) in the matched non-active chemotherapy group. The risk of death was positively associated with palliative intent of treatment and hematologic neoplasms. Being in active chemotherapy was not associated with increased mortality compared to non-active treatment. We also noted in exploratory propensity-score matchings that the use of alkylating agents (odds ratio [OR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.70) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.56) were protective factors.

Older people with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and in particular hypertension, are at higher risk of hospitalization and death for COVID-19. Whether hypertensionmedicationsmay increase the risk for death in older COVID 19 inpatients at the highest risk for the disease is currently unknown. Method(s): Data from 5,625 COVID-19 inpatients were manually extracted from medical charts from 61 hospitals across Italy. From the initial 5,625 patients, 3,179 were included in the study as they were either discharged or deceased at the time of the data analysis. Primary outcome was inpatient death or recovery. Mixed effects logistic regression models were adjusted for sex, age, and number of comorbidities, with a random effect for site. Result(s): A large proportion of participating inpatients were >=65 years old (58%), male (68%), non-smokers (93%) with comorbidities (66%). Each additional comorbidity increased the risk of death by 35% [adjOR = 1.35 (1.2, 1.5) p < 0.001]. Use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers or Ca-antagonists was not associated with significantly increased risk of death. There was a marginal negative association between ARB use and death, and a marginal positive association between diuretic use and death. Conclusion(s): This Italian nationwide observational study of COVID-19 inpatients, the majority of which >=65 years old, indicates that there is a linear direct relationship between the number of comorbidities and the risk of death. Among CVDs, hypertension and pre-existing cardiomyopathy were significantly associated with risk of death. The use of hypertension medications reported to be safe in younger cohorts, do not contribute significantly to increased COVID-19 related deaths in an older population that suffered one of the highest death tolls worldwide.Copyright © 2020 Polverino, Stern, Ruocco, Balestro, Bassetti, Candelli, Cirillo, Contoli, Corsico, D'Amico, D'Elia, Falco, Gasparini, Guerra, Harari, Kraft, Mennella, Papi, Parrella, Pelosi, Poletti, Polverino, Tana, Terribile, Woods, Di Marco, Martinez and the ItaliCO study group.",2020,//,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,7,,585866-585866,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.585866,,#62034,F 2020,"Muhammad Hasan (2023-11-05 23:12:28)(Select): Divided into blood cancer and organ cancer, multivariate analysis provided for risk of death due to covid.

Patients with cancer are immunocompromised and may be vulnerable to COVID-related morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with cancer have worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. METHODS We used data from adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two New York-Presbyterian hospitals between March 3 and May 15, 2020. Patients with cancer were matched 1:4 to controls without cancer in terms of age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, we compared morbidity (intensive care unit admission and intubation) and mortality outcomes between patients with cancer and controls. Among those with cancer, we identified demographic and clinical predictors of worse outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS We included 585 patients who were COVID-19 positive, of whom 117 had active malignancy, defined as those receiving cancer-directed therapy or under active surveillance within 6 months of admission. Presenting symptoms and in-hospital complications were similar between the cancer and noncancer groups. Nearly one half of patients with cancer were receiving therapy, and 45% of patients received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment within 90 days of admission. There were no statistically significant differences in morbidity or mortality (P 5.894) between patients with and without cancer. CONCLUSION We observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer. This finding suggests that a diagnosis of active cancer alone and recent anticancer therapy do not predict worse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore, recommendations to limit cancer-directed therapy must be considered carefully in relation to cancer-specific outcomes and death.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",2020,//,Journal of Clinical Oncology,38,33,3914-3924,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.20.01580,,#62120,G 2020,James Morris (2023-10-11 21:13:48)(Select): cancer within 6 months; ,haematological cancers included; true cancer vs non-cancer
Cancer History and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy Independently Predict COVID-19 Mortality: A UK Tertiary Hospital Experience,"C.C.T., Sng; Y.N.S., Wong; A., Wu; D., Ottaviani; N., Chopra; M., Galazi; S., Benafif; G., Soosaipillai; R., Roylance; A.J.X., Lee; , Shaw H","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic remains a pressing concern to patients with cancer as countries enter the second peak of the pandemic and beyond. It remains unclear whether cancer and its treatment contribute an independent risk for mortality in COVID-19. Method(s): We included patients at a London tertiary hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients with a history of solid cancer were included. Age- and sex-matched patients without cancer were randomly selected. Patients with hematological malignancies were excluded. Result(s): We identified 94 patients with cancer, matched to 226 patients without cancer. After adjusting for age, ethnicity, and co-morbidities, patients with cancer had increased mortality following COVID-19 (HR 1.57, 95% CI:1.04-2.4, p = 0.03). Increasing age (HR 1.49 every 10 years, 95% CI:1.25-1.8, p < 0.001), South Asian ethnicity (HR 2.92, 95% CI:1.73-4.9, p < 0.001), and cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.93, 95% CI:1.18-3.2, p = 0.008) also predicted mortality. Within the cancer cohort, systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) within 60 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.16-4.6, p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Along with known risk factors, cancer and SACT confer an independent risk for mortality following COVID-19. Further studies are needed to understand the socio-economic influences and pathophysiology of these associations.© Copyright © 2020 Sng, Wong, Wu, Ottaviani, Chopra, Galazi, Benafif, Soosaipillai, Roylance, Lee and Shaw.",2020,//,Frontiers in Oncology,10,,595804-595804,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.595804,,#62182,C 2020,Shazia  Sarela (2023-11-03 10:38:25)(Select): mortality data for cancer vs non cancer not in table but included in results text ; ,true cancer vs non-cancer

We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using cycle threshold (CT) values from reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays applied to nasopharyngeal swab specimens in 100 patients with cancer and 2,914 without cancer who were admitted to three New York City hospitals. Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate was 38.8% among patients with a high viral load, 24.1% among patients with a medium viral load, and 15.3% among patients with a low viral load (p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in patients with cancer (high, 45.2% mortality; medium, 28.0%; low, 12.1%; p = 0.008). Patients with hematologic malignancies had higher median viral loads (CT = 25.0) than patients without cancer (CT = 29.2; p = 0.0039). SARS-CoV-2 viral load results may offer vital prognostic information for patients with and without cancer who are hospitalized with COVID-19. Westblade et al. reveal that admission viral load independently predicts mortality in hospitalized patients with and without cancer who have COVID-19, and that patients with hematologic malignancies have higher admission viral loads than patients with solid tumors or without cancer.

I’ve had a long look at this paper to check if we can use it. We can indeed calculate the odds ratios and 95% CI of the log(OR) and, by extension of the OR itself, using table 1, thus completing our comorbidities table in the data extraction form. It would be acceptable to use the univariate OR of mortality given in table 4 for haematological and solid cancers as our OR for the primary cancer site table in the data extraction as this is a “true cancer vs non cancer” study and table 1 confirms that the groups are controlled for age, gender and obesity as well as several other comorbidities (although some do vary significantly between the groups such as ethnicity - this is up to standard with how were judging the “cancer as a comorbidity” papers). Note that they actually give unajusted i.e. univariate, ORs in table 4 for cancer site, not multivariate aORs, as haematological vs solid yielded an OR of 1.00. We couldnt directly calculate an aOR using a multiple regression with the data in table 1 as we don’t know which comorbidities were present in all four of the following cohorts: active cancer + died; active cancer + survived; no active cancer + died; no active cancer + survived. From a statistical point of view, we can definitely include it. My only qualm with this paper is they define active cancer as active surveillance within 6 months or treatment within 6 months, while no active cancer, the non cancer coontrol, is defined as everyone else, hence, someone who had chemotherapy for cancer 181 days before admission is treated the same as a healthy individual who has never had cancer.

Looking at figure S1 in the supplementary material, the interquartile range for the all three of these cohorts using both of the two assays included CT values > 30. HOWEVER, COVID-19 +ve patients were identified using CT cut-offs of  <25 for cobas ORF1ab and <27 for Xpert Xpress N2 to define high viral load. Moderate viral load in the Cobas assay ONLY also included values 25-30, however, moderate for Xpert Xpress included 27-32 so is invalid.

For data extraction: we are told the numbers of cancer pts identified via each assay (Table 1) and the mortality rates of cancer patients versus cancer +noncancer patients in table 3 as defined by each individual assay and tercile. therefore, we are able to maximise statistical power by including the high viral load cohort for the Xpert Xpress assay and BOTH the moderate and high viral load cohorts for the Cobas assays.

Here, we present an analysis of cancer patients from the LEOSS (Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients) registry to determine whether cancer patients are at higher risk. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 435 cancer patients and 2636 non-cancer patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled between March 16 and August 31, 2020. Data on socio-demographics, comorbidities, cancer-related features and infection course were collected. Age-, sex- and comorbidity-adjusted analysis was performed. Primary endpoint was COVID-19-related mortality. Result(s): In total, 435 cancer patients were included in our analysis. Commonest age category was 76-85 years (36.5%), and 40.5% were female. Solid tumors were seen in 59% and lymphoma and leukemia in 17.5% and 11% of patients. Of these, 54% had an active malignancy, and 22% had recently received anti-cancer treatments. At detection of SARS-CoV-2, the majority (62.5%) presented with mild symptoms. Progression to severe COVID-19 was seen in 55% and ICU admission in 27.5%. COVID-19-related mortality rate was 22.5%. Male sex, advanced age, and active malignancy were associated with higher death rates. Comparing cancer and non-cancer patients, age distribution and comorbidity differed significantly, as did mortality (14% vs 22.5%, p value < 0.001). After adjustments for other risk factors, mortality was comparable. Conclusion(s): Comparing cancer and non-cancer patients, outcome of COVID-19 was comparable after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity.

Method(s): A total of 753 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 22, 2020 to May 7, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from the electronic medical records of Wuhan Union Hospital and were exhaustively analyzed using R (version 3.6.1). Result(s): A total of 493 severe and 228 critical cases out of 753 COVID-19 cases were considered in this study. Among the critical cases, the death rate was 79.4%, and age was a risk factor for death. Compared to the severe disease group, the critical disease group had higher white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts and a decreased lymphocyte count at admission. Compared to early death cases (death within 1 week after admission), a more prolonged course of the disease was associated with a higher risk of hypoproteinemia, liver injury, thrombocytopenia, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation disorders, acute kidney injury (AKI), and infection. Higher creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were related to early death events, but univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed only LDH as an independent predictor of early death. Notably, anticoagulation therapy was associated with an improved prognosis of critical cases in this cohort. Conclusion(s): Our results showed large differences between patients with severe and critical COVID-19. During the course of COVID-19 in the critical disease group, the incidence of hypoproteinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders increased significantly, which highlighted the importance of medical care in the first week after admission. LDH could act as an independent predictor of early death in critical cases, and anticoagulation therapy was correlated with an improved prognosis of patients with critical COVID-19.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,//,Infectious Diseases and Therapy,10,1,421-438,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40121-020-00379-2,,#64187,Z 2021,"",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

Method(s): We performed a multicentre, retrospective study involving 13 COVID-19 Units in Campania region from February to May 2020. We defined as severe COVID-19 presentation the cases that required mechanical ventilation and/or admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and/or in case of death. Result(s): We enrolled 371 COVID-19 patients, of whom 34 (9.2%) had a history or a diagnosis of cancer (24 solid, 6 onco-hematological). Oncologic patients were older (p<0.001), had more comorbidities (p<0.001) and showed a higher rate of severe COVID-19 presentation (p=0.001) and of death (p<0.001). Compared to 12 patients with non-active cancer and to 337 without cancer, the 17 patients with active cancer had more comorbidities and showed a higher rate of severe COVID-19 and of mortality (all p values <0.001). Compared to the 281 non-severe patients, the 90 subjects with a severe presentation of COVID-19 were older (p<0.01), with more comorbidities (p<0.001) and with a higher rate of cancer (p=0.001).

Method(s): Data reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), up to 15 July, when COVID-19 was confirmed were used as research data in connection with the National Health Insurance Service's (NHIS) national health information database. The final analysis targets were 12,646 confirmed patients and 303 deaths. The survival rate of patients with COVID-19 was estimated through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to search for factors affecting survival. Result(s): When looking at the survival rate by age group for men and women, the 28-day survival rate for men aged >80 years was 77% and 73% at 42 days, while 83% and 81% for women. Men had a worse survival rate than women. For chronic diseases, the highest risk of mortality was observed in malignant neoplasms of the respiratory and urogenital systems, followed by diseases of the urinary system and diabetes. Conclusion(s): The number of COVID-19 deaths was highest the next day after initial diagnosis.

Severity of COVID-19 in Cancer patients versus patients without Cancer: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis,"C., Liu; K., Wang; L., Li; Q., Lv; Y., Liu; T., Hu; J.C., Trent; B., Sun; , Hu Q","Purpose: Data are extremely limited with regards to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Our study explored the distinct clinical features of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Experimental Design: 189 COVID-19 patients, including 16 cancer patients and 173 patients without cancer, were recruited. Propensity score 1:4 matching (PSM) was performed between cancer patients and patients without cancer based on age, gender and comorbidities. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was compared by the log-rank test. Result(s): PSM analysis yielded 16 cancer patients and 64 propensity score-matched patients without cancer. Compared to patients without cancer, cancer patients tended to have leukopenia and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin. For those with critical COVID-19, cancer patients had an inferior survival than those without cancer. Also, cancer patients with severe/critical COVID-19 tended to be male and present with low SPO2 and albumin, and high hs-CRP, lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen on admission compared to those with mild COVID-19. In terms of risk factors, recent cancer diagnosis (within 1 year of onset of COVID-19) and anti-Tumor treatment within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Conclusion(s): We found COVID-19 patients with cancer have distinct clinical features as compared to patients without cancer. Importantly, cancer patients with critical COVID-19 were found to have poorer outcomes compared to those without cancer. In the cancer cohort, patients with severe/critical COVID-19 presented with a distinct clinical profile from those with mild COVID-19; short cancer history and recent anti-cancer treatment were associated with inferior survival.Copyright © 2021 Ivyspring International Publisher.

SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Is Correlated With the Disease Severity and Mortality in Patients With Cancer,"M., Al-Mozaini; A.S.M., Noman; J., Alotaibi; M.R., Karim; A.S.M., Zahed; A.T.M.R., Karim; K., Alromiah; , Islam S S","The correlation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load and risk of disease severity in cancer patients is poorly understood. Given the fact that cancer patients are at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), analysis of viral load and disease outcome in COVID-19-infected cancer patients is needed. Here, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 viral load using qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values collected from 120 noncancer and 64 cancer patients' nasopharyngeal swab samples who are admitted to hospitals. Our results showed that the in-hospital mortality for high viral load cancer patients was 41.38%, 23.81% for medium viral load and 14.29% for low viral load patients (p < -0.01). On the other hand, the mortality rate for noncancer patients was lower: 22.22% among patients with high viral load, 5.13% among patients with medium viral load, and 1.85% among patients with low viral load (p < 0.05). In addition, patients with lung and hematologic cancer showed higher possibilities of severe events in proportion to high viral load. Higher attributable mortality and severity were directly proportional to high viral load particularly in patients who are receiving anticancer treatment. Importantly, we found that the incubation period and serial interval time is shorter in cancer patients compared with noncancer cases. Our report suggests that high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads may play a significant role in the overall mortality and severity of COVID-19-positive cancer patients, and this warrants further study to explore the disease pathogenesis and their use as prognostic tools.© Copyright © 2021 Al-Mozaini, Noman, Alotaibi, Karim, Zahed, Karim, Alromiah and Islam.",2021,//,Frontiers in Oncology,11,,715794-715794,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.715794,,#65461,M 2021,"James Morris (2023-11-27 01:17:27)(Included): included after DE begun, assigned to myself for DE and QA; James Morris (2023-11-27 01:15:37)(Select): matched all out definitions exactly and is direct cancer vs non cancer.

Method(s): We analysed clinical data from 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Uni-multivariable analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors of COVID-19 survival; propensity score matching was used to estimate the impact of cancer. Result(s): Of 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 46 had active cancer (8%). Comorbidities included diabetes (n = 137, 25%), hypertension (n = 284, 51%), coronary artery disease (n = 114, 20%) and dyslipidaemia (n = 122, 22%). Oncologic patients were older (mean age 71 vs 65, p = 0.012), more often smokers (20% vs 8%, p = 0.009), with higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (13.3 vs 8.2, p = 0.046). Fatality rate was 50% (CI 95%: 34.9;65.1) in cancer patients and 20.2% (CI 95%: 16.8;23.9) in the non-oncologic population.

Propensity score matching showed a 1.92x risk of death in active cancer patients compared to non-oncologic patients (p = 0.013), adjusted for ICU-related bias. We observed a median OS of 14 days for cancer patients vs 35 days for other patients. Conclusion(s): A near-doubled death rate between cancer and non-cancer COVID-19 patients was reported.

We undertook this study to identify the factors associated with adverse outcomes in patients with CLD who acquire the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): We conducted a multi-center, observational cohort study across 21 institutions in the United States (US) of adult patients with CLD and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. We performed survival analysis to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality and COVID-19 related mortality, and multivariate logistic regression to determine the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with CLD. Result(s): Of the 978 patients in our cohort, 867 patients (mean age 56.9 +/- 14.5 years, 55% male) met inclusion criteria. The overall all-cause mortality was 14.0% (n = 121), and 61.7% (n = 535) had severe COVID-19. Patients presenting with diarrhea or nausea/vomiting were more likely to have severe COVID-19. The liver-specific factors associated with independent risk of higher overall mortality were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-4.55), decompensated cirrhosis (HR 2.91 [1.70-5.00]) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR 3.31 [1.53-7.16]). Other factors were increasing age, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoker. Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 2.33 [1.47-3.70]) and decompensated cirrhosis (OR 2.50 [1.20-5.21]) were independently associated with risk for severe COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The risk factors which predict higher overall mortality among patients with CLD and COVID-19 are ALD, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC. Hispanic ethnicity and decompensated cirrhosis are associated with severe COVID-19.

Here, we describe determinants of mortality in patients with solid cancer comparing the first and second waves of COVID-19. A retrospective analysis encompassing two waves of COVID-19 (March-May 2020; December 2020-February 2021) was performed. 207 patients with cancer were matched to 452 patients without cancer. Patient demographics and oncological variables such as cancer subtype, staging and anti-cancer treatment were evaluated for association with COVID-19 mortality. Overall mortality was lower in wave two compared to wave one, HR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.30-0.56). In patients with cancer, mortality was 43.6% in wave one and 15.9% in wave two. In hospitalized patients, after adjusting for age, ethnicity and co-morbidities, a history of cancer was associated with increased mortality in wave one but not wave two. In summary, the second UK wave of COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients. A history of solid cancer was not associated with increased mortality despite the dominance of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. In both waves, metastatic disease and systemic anti-cancer treatment appeared to be independent risk factors for death within the combined cancer cohort.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Immunological alternation in COVID-19 patients with cancer and its implications on mortality,"G., Cai; Y., Gao; S., Zeng; Y., Yu; X., Liu; D., Liu; Y., Wang; R., Yu; A., Desai; C., Li; Gao Q.  AO  - Cai, Guangyao; ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0943-0106","Patients with malignancy were reportedly more susceptible and vulnerable to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and witnessed a greater mortality risk in COVID-19 infection than noncancerous patients. But the role of immune dysregulation of malignant patients on poor prognosis of COVID-19 has remained insufficiently investigated. Here we conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 2,052 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Cancer, n = 93; Non-cancer, n = 1,959), and compared the immunological characteristics of both cohorts. We used stratification analysis, multivariate regressions, and propensity-score matching to evaluate the effect of immunological indices. In result, COVID-19 patients with cancer had ongoing and significantly elevated inflammatory factors and cytokines (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8), as well as decreased immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, Th and Ts cells) than those without cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cancer cohort (24.7%) than non-cancer cohort (10.8%). By stratification analysis, COVID-19 patients with immune dysregulation had poorer prognosis than those with the relatively normal immune system both in cancer and non-cancer cohort. By logistic regression, Cox regression, and propensity-score matching, we found that prior to adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was associated with an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 (p < .05); after adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was no longer an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19 (p > .30). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with cancer had more severely dysregulated immune responses than noncancerous patients, which might account for their poorer prognosis.

We retrospectively reviewed cohort data from 7,590 de-identified patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed using severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction test up to May 15, 2020. We used linked-medical claims data provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea. Underlying diseases were identified using the diagnostic codes in the patients' files from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The total mortality rate was 3.0% in patients with COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex, and concomitant chronic conditions, we found that congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, diabetes without chronic complications, renal diseases, and malignancy were factors that significantly increased the cost of treatment. Cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and paralysis were found to be independent factors significant in prolonging hospital stay. Diabetes with chronic complications was independently associated with intensive care unit admission. In addition, underlying congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR], 1.724; P = 0.003), dementia (OR, 1.598; P = 0.012), diabetes with and without chronic complications (OR, 1.821; P = 0.002 and OR, 1.518; P = 0.022, respectively), renal disease (OR, 2.299; P = 0.002), and malignancy (OR, 1.529; P = 0.039) were significant factors associated with death, even after adjustments. Underlying diseases were significant independent factors of the poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. The effects were variable according to the type of underlying disease and clinical outcome. Therefore, patients with COVID-19 with underlying diseases should be monitored more closely because they are more at risk of a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2021 Choi et al.

A propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed, including 103 COVID-19 patients with cancer and 206 matched non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Next, we identified death related risk factors and developed a nomogram for predicting the probability. Result(s): In 103 COVID-19 patients with cancer, the main cancer categories were breast cancer, lung cancer and bladder cancer. Compared to non-severe patients, severe patients had a higher median age, and a higher proportion of smokers, diabetes, heart disease and dyspnea. In addition, most of the laboratory results between two groups were significantly different. PSM analysis found that the proportion of dyspnea was much higher in COVID-19 patients with cancer. The severity incidence in two groups were similar, while a much higher mortality was found in COVID-19 patients with cancer compared to that in COVID-19 patients without cancer (11.7% vs. 4.4%, P = 0.028).

The underlying conditions were retrieved for all contiguous stays. In-hospital mortality and associated risk factors were assessed using frailty Cox models. Among the 98 366 patients included, 25 765 (26%) were admitted to a CCU. The median age was 66 (IQR: 55-76) years in CCUs and 74 (IQR: 57-85) years in HCUs. Age was the main risk factor of death in both CCUs and HCUs, with adjusted HRs (aHRs) in CCUs increasing from 1.60 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.88) for 46 to 65 years to 8.17 (95% CI 6.86 to 9.72) for >=85 years. In HCUs, the aHR associated with age was more than two times higher. The gender was not significantly associated with death, aHR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, p=0.2693) in CCUs. Most of the underlying chronic conditions were risk factors for death, including malignant neoplasm (CCU: 1.34 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.43); HCU: 1.41 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.47)), cirrhosis without transplant (1.41 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.64); 1.27 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.45)) and dementia (1.30 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.46); 1.07 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.12)).

METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a multi-hospital, academic medical institution in New York City. Outcomes included mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and AKI among hospitalized patients. We also evaluated risk of hospitalization among all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multilevel logistic regression models were used for analysis. RESULT(S): We identified 6,893 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 4,018 were hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients 374 (9%) had a history of cancer, 281 (7%) experienced AKI, and 1,045 (26%) died.

The predictive value of the original Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) for mortality in these patients were investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among 7590 patients, 227 (3.0%) had died. After age and sex adjustment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. The ROC curve analysis showed that an ACCI threshold>3.5 yielded the best cut-off point for predicting mortality (area under the ROC 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.94). Our study revealed multiple risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. The high predictive power of the ACCI for mortality in our results can support the importance of old age and comorbidities in the severity of COVID-19.",2021,//,Scientific reports,11,1,6375-6375,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85813-2,,#66236,S 2021,"",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments
COVID-19 amongst cancer patients: An experience from Oman,"B.J., Al Bahrani; I., Mehdi; F.A., Khamis; A.M., Al Farsi; F.A., Fahdi; , Al Lawati N A","Objective: To evaluate the extent of coronavirus infection in cancer patients along with their demographics, laboratory findings and outcomes in a tertiary care setting. Method(s): The study was conducted in Muscat, Oman, from March 24 to October 23, 2020. The data was collected from the cancer registry of the Directorate-General of Non-Communicable Diseases, Ministry of Health, Oman. Data of inpatient coronavirus cases were retrieved from the electronic medical records system of the Royal Hospital, Muscat, all tertiary hospitals linked electronically to the registry and the coronavirus registry of Oman. The data of cancer patients infected with coronavirus was analysed and compared with non-cancer coronavirus-infected patients. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS 2019 v26. Result(s): Of the 16,260 cancer patients, 77(0.47%) were infected with COVID-19 compared to 111,837(2.17%) in the national population. Mortality among cancer patients with COVID-19 was high 27(35.1%) compared to 1,147(1.03%) in the national population. Cancer patients with COVID-19 also had diabetes 15(20%), hypertension 20(26%), renal complications 15(20%) and cardiac issues 9(12%). Of the total, 32(41.6%) cancer patients with COVID-19 had received active cancer treatment within the preceding 4 weeks. Conclusion(s): The data on coronavirus infection outcome is emerging at a rapid pace focussing on the impact of underlying diseases, and the capacity of healthcare systems. Oncologists should customise cancer management, while cancer patients must practise social distancing, and seek prompt evaluation of suspicious symptoms.Copyright © 2021 Pakistan Medical Association.

Methods The present study was a multicenter, retrospective study that retrieved the data of all Egyptian cases with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to hospitals affiliated to the General Organization for Teaching Hospitals and Institutes (GOTHI) through the period from March to July 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory test. Results This retrospective study included 2724 COVID-19 patients, of whom 423 (15.52%) were critically ill. Approximately 45.86% of the critical group aged above 60 years, compared to 39.59% in the non-critical group (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis showed that many factors were predictors of critically illness, including age >60 years (OR = 1.30, 95% CI [1.05, 1.61], p = 0.014), low oxygen saturation (OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.91, 0.95], p<0.001), low Glasgow coma scale (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.67, 0.84], p<0.001), diabetes (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.26, 2.08], p<0.001), cancer (OR = 2.47, 95% CI [1.41, 4.35], p = 0.002), and serum ferritin (OR = 1.004, 95% CI [1.0003, 1.008], p = 0.031). Conclusion In the present report, we demonstrated that many factors are associated with COVID-19 critical illness, including older age groups, fatigue, elevated temperature, increased pulse, lower oxygen saturation, the preexistence of diabetes, malignancies, cardiovascular disease, renal diseases, and pulmonary disease. Moreover, elevated serum levels of ALT, AST, and ferritin are associated with worse outcomes. Further studies are required to identify independent predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Omran et al.

In this multicenter cohort study, 166 COVID-19 patients with cancer were compared with 498 non-cancer COVID-19 patients and 498 non-COVID cancer patients. The 1-year all-cause mortality and hospital mortality rates in Cancer COVID-19 Cohort (30% and 20%) were significantly higher than those in COVID-19 Cohort (9% and 8%, both P <.001) and Cancer Cohort (16% and 2%, both P < 0.001). The 12-month all-cause post-discharge mortality rate in survival discharged Cancer COVID-19 Cohort (8%) was higher than that in COVID-19 Cohort (0.4%, P <.001) but similar to that in Cancer Cohort (15%, P =.084). The incidence of sequelae in Cancer COVID-19 Cohort (23%, 26/114) is similar to that in COVID-19 Cohort (30%, 130/432, P =.13). The 1-year all-cause mortality was high among patients with hematologic malignancies (59%), followed by those who have nasopharyngeal, brain, and skin tumors (45%), digestive system neoplasm (43%), and lung cancers (32%). The rate was moderate among patients with genitourinary (14%), female genital (13%), breast (11%), and thyroid tumors (0). COVID-19 patients with cancer showed a high rate of in-hospital mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality, but the 12-month all-cause post-discharge mortality rate in survival discharged cancer COVID-19 patients was similar to that in Cancer Cohort. Comparing to COVID-19 Cohort, risk stratification showed that hematologic, nasopharyngeal, brain, digestive system, and lung tumors were high risk (44% vs 9%, P < 0.001), while genitourinary, female genital, breast, and thyroid tumors had moderate risk (10% vs 9%, P =.85) in COVID-19 Cancer Cohort. Different tumor subtypes had different effects on COVID-19. But if cancer patients with COVID-19 manage to survive their COVID-19 infections, then long-term mortality appears to be similar to the cancer patients without COVID-19, and their long-term clinical sequelae were similar to the COVID-19 patients without cancer.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Method(s): This nationwide retrospective cohort study describes patients with prior lung disease hospitalized for COVID-19 (March-April 2020) or influenza (2018-2019 influenza outbreak). We compare the resulting pulmonary complications, need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on respiratory history and virus. Result(s): In the 89, 530 COVID-19 cases, 16.03% had at least one CRD, which was significantly less frequently than in the 45, 819 seasonal influenza patients. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension were underrepresented, contrary to those with lung cancer, sleep apnea, emphysema, and interstitial pulmonary diseases (ILD). COVID-19 patients with CRD developed significantly more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. They needed intensive care significantly more often and had a higher mortality rate (except for asthma) when compared to patients with COVID-19 but without CRD, or patients with influenza. Conclusion(s): Patients with prior respiratory diseases were globally less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than for influenza but were at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and had a higher mortality rate compared to influenza patients and patients without a history of respiratory illness.Copyright ©The authors 2021.",2021,//,European Respiratory Journal,58,6,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1183/13993003.04474-2020,,#66665,G 2021,"Fazal Shah (2023-10-10 21:30:52)(Select): OR in Table 5 for lung cancer vs. no chronic respiratory diseases.

Evaluation of COVID-19 Mortality and Adverse Outcomes in US Patients with or Without Cancer,"M., Chavez-Macgregor; X., Lei; H., Zhao; P., Scheet; , Giordano S H","Importance: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, understanding the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19 has become critically important. Objective(s): To compare the outcomes of patients with or without cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospitalization. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study obtained data from the Optum de-identified COVID-19 electronic health record data set. More than 500000 US adults who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were analyzed. Exposures: The patient groups were (1) patients without cancer, (2) patients with no recent cancer treatment, and (3) patients with recent cancer treatment (within 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis) consisting of radiation therapy or systemic therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were the main outcomes. Unadjusted rates and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of adverse outcomes were presented according to exposure group. Result(s): A total of 507307 patients with COVID-19 were identified (mean [SD] age, 48.4 [18.4] years; 281 165 women [55.4%]), of whom 493020 (97.2%) did not have cancer. Among the 14287 (2.8%) patients with cancer, 9991 (69.9%) did not receive recent treatment and 4296 (30.1%) received recent treatment. In unadjusted analyses, patients with cancer, regardless of recent treatment received, were more likely to have adverse outcomes compared with patients without cancer (eg, mortality rate: 1.6% for patients without cancer, 5.0% for patients with no recent cancer treatment, and 7.8% for patients with recent cancer treatment). After adjustment, patients with no recent cancer treatment had similar or better outcomes than patients without cancer (eg, mortality OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.84-1.02]; mechanical ventilation OR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.54-0.68]). In contrast, a higher risk of death (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.54-1.96), ICU stay (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.54-1.87), and hospitalization (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27) was observed in patients with recent cancer treatment. Compared with patients with nonmetastatic solid tumors, those with metastatic solid tumors and hematologic malignant neoplasms had worse outcomes (eg, mortality OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.96-2.84]; mechanical ventilation OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.70-1.08]). Recent chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy were also associated with worse outcomes (eg, chemotherapy mortality OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.51-2.26]). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that patients with recent cancer treatment and COVID-19 had a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes, and patients with no recent cancer treatment had similar outcomes to those without cancer.

Method(s): Study patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 molecular-testing between 22 February 2020 and 31 July 2020, and were found infected (CoV2+ve) or uninfected. History of malignancy was obtained from regional population-based cancer registries. Cancer-patients were distinguished by time between cancer diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 testing (<12/12 months). Comorbidities, hospitalization, and death at 15 September 2020 were retrieved from regional population-based databases. The impact of cancer history on SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes was calculated by fitting a multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities. Result(s): Among 552,362 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 55,206 (10.0%) were cancer-patients and 22,564 (4.1%) tested CoV2+ve. Irrespective of time since cancer diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower among cancer patients (1,787; 3.2%) than non-cancer individuals (20,777; 4.2% - Odds Ratio (OR)=0.60; 0.57-0.63). CoV2+ve cancer-patients were older than non-cancer individuals (median age: 77 versus 57 years; p<0.0001), were more frequently men and with comorbidities. Hospitalizations (39.9% versus 22.5%; OR=1.61; 1.44-1.80) and deaths (24.3% versus 9.7%; OR=1.51; 1.32-1.72) were more frequent in cancer-patients. CoV2+ve cancer-patients were at higher risk of death (lung OR=2.90; 1.58-5.24, blood OR=2.73; 1.88-3.93, breast OR=1.77; 1.32-2.35). Conclusion(s): The risks of hospitalization and death are significantly higher in CoV2+ve individuals with past or present cancer (particularly malignancies of the lung, hematologic or breast) than in those with no history of cancer.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2022.",2022,//,Tumori,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03008916211073771,,#67122,M 2022,"Mark Cheng (2023-12-29 11:47:13)(Included): figshare needs to be checked and analysed

Clinical Course of Cancer Patients With COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"N., Alpert; J.L., Rapp; B., Marcellino; W., Lieberman-Cribbin; R., Flores; Taioli E.  AO  - Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6851-6009","Background: Complications in cancer patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been examined. This analysis aimed to compare characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer and assess whether cancer is associated with COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. Method(s): COVID-19-positive patients with an inpatient or emergency encounter at the Mount Sinai Health System between March 1, 2020, and May 27, 2020, were included and compared across cancer status on demographics and clinical characteristics. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to model the associations of cancer with sepsis, venous thromboembolism, acute kidney injury, intensive care unit admission, and all-cause mortality. Result(s): There were 5556 COVID-19-positive patients included, 421 (7.6%) with cancer (325 solid, 96 nonsolid). Those with cancer were statistically significantly older, more likely to be non-Hispanic Black and to be admitted to the hospital during their encounter, and had more comorbidities than noncancer COVID-19 patients. Cancer patients were statistically significantly more likely to develop sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.61) and venous thromboembolism (ORadj = 1.77, 95% CI=1.01 to 3.09); there was no statistically significant difference in acute kidney injury (ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI=0.87 to 1.39), intensive care unit admissions (ORadj = 1.04, 95% CI=0.80 to 1.34), or mortality (ORadj = 1.02, 95% CI=0.81 to 1.29). Conclusion(s): COVID-19 patients with cancer may have a higher risk for adverse outcomes. Although there was no statistically significant difference in mortality, COVID-19 patients with cancer have statistically significantly higher risk of thromboembolism and sepsis.

COVID-19-related outcomes in immunocompromised patients: A nationwide study in Korea,"M.S., Baek; M.-T., Lee; W.-Y., Kim; J.C., Choi; , Jung S.-Y.","Background Given the rapid increased in confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related mortality, it is important to identify vulnerable patients. Immunocompromised status is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality. Method The groups' baseline characteristics were balanced using a propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the risks of in-hospital mortality and other outcomes according to immunocompromised status using a multivariable logistic regression model. We identified immunocompromised status based on a diagnosis of malignancy or HIV/ AIDS, having undergone organ transplantation within 3 years, prescriptions for corticosteroids or oral immunosuppressants for >=30 days, and at least one prescription for non-oral immunosuppressants during the last year. Results The 6,435 COVID-19 patients (>=18 years) included 871 immunocompromised (13.5%) and 5,564 non-immunocompromised (86.5%). Immunocompromised COVID-19 patients were older (60.1+/-16.4 years vs. 47.1+/-18.7 years, absolute standardized mean difference: 0.738). The immunocompromised group had more comorbidities, a higher Charlson comorbidity index, and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (9.6% vs. 2.3%; p < .001). The immunocompromised group still had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate after inverse probability of treatment weighting (6.4% vs. 2.0%, p < .001). Multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline imbalances revealed that immunocompromised status was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.62-2.68, p < .001). Conclusions Immunocompromised status among COVID-19 patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality.Copyright © 2021 Baek et al.

Endothelial activation and stress index (Easix) as an early predictor for mortality and overall survival in hematological and non-hematological patients with covid-19: Multicenter cohort study,"E., Kalicinska; M., Biernat; J., Rybka; A., Zinczuk; J., Janocha-litwin; M., Rosiek-biegus; M., Morawska; A., Waszczuk-gajda; J., Drozd-sokolowska; L., Szukalski; M., Rymko; P., Jablonowska; K., Simon; , Wrobel T","COVID-19, as a disease involving the endothelium of multiple organs, is characterized by high mortality rates among hospitalized patients. Patients with hematological malignancies are particularly at risk of an unfavorable course of COVID-19. The endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) score has been used as a simple predictor of overall survival (OS) in specific groups of hematological cancer patients. EASIX, as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, might play a prognostic role in patients with COVID-19. Here, we performed a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the EASIX score in 523 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without coexisting hematological cancer. Hematological cancer COVID-19 patients had higher EASIX scores compared to the overall population with COVID-19. In hematological patients, EASIX was a strong predictor of the occurrence of sepsis during COVID-19. Our findings demonstrated EASIX as a strong predictor of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital mortality, the occurrence of acute renal failure and the need for hemodialysis, both in hematological and non-hematological COVID-19 patients. Patients with a high EASIX score on COVID-19 diagnosis had significantly inferior OS compared to patients with low EASIX. We showed for the first time that EASIX might serve as a simple, universal prognostic tool of OS in both hematological and non-hematological COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.",2021,//,Journal of Clinical Medicine,10,19,4373-4373,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194373,,#67363,E 2021,"Justine Chan (2023-11-06 04:49:34)(Select): Mortality rates were higher

Outcomes of Patients With Active Cancer and COVID-19 in the Intensive-Care Unit: A Multicenter Ambispective Study,"H., Plais; M., Labruyere; T., Creutin; P., Nay; G., Plantefeve; R., Tapponnier; M., Jonas; N.T., Ngapmen; L., Le Guennec; C., De Roquetaillade; L., Argaud; M., Jamme; C., Goulenok; K., Merouani; M., Leclerc; B., Sauneuf; S., Shidasp; A., Stoclin; A., Bardet; O., Mir; N., Ibrahimi; , Llitjos J.-F.","Background: Several studies report an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. However, data in the intensive care unit (ICU) are scarce. Research Question: We aimed to investigate the association between active cancer and mortality among patients requiring organ support in the ICU. Study Design and Methods: In this ambispective study encompassing 17 hospitals in France, we included all adult active cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring organ support and admitted in ICU. For each cancer patient, we included 3 non cancer patients as controls. Patients were matched at the same ratio using the inverse probability weighting approach based on a propensity score assessing the probability of cancer at admission. Mortality at day 60 after ICU admission was compared between cancer patients and non-cancer patients using primary logistic regression analysis and secondary multivariable analyses. Result(s): Between March 12, 2020 and March 8, 2021, 2608 patients were admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our study, accounting for 2.8% of the total population of patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted in all French ICUs within the same period. Among them, 105 (n=4%) presented with cancer (51 patients had hematological malignancy and 54 patients had solid tumors). 409 of 420 patients were included in the propensity score matching process, of whom 307 patients in the non-cancer group and 102 patients in the cancer group. 145 patients (35%) died in the ICU at day 60, 59 (56%) with cancer and 86 (27%) without cancer. In the primary logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for death associated to cancer was 2.3 (95%CI 1.24 - 4.28, p=0.0082) higher for cancer patients than for a non-cancer patient at ICU admission. Exploratory multivariable analyses showed that solid tumor (OR: 2.344 (0.87-6.31), p=0.062) and hematological malignancies (OR: 4.144 (1.24-13.83), p=0.062) were independently associated with mortality. Interpretation(s): Patients with cancer and requiring ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 infection had an increased mortality, hematological malignancy harboring the higher risk in comparison to solid tumors.Copyright © 2022 Plais, Labruyere, Creutin, Nay, Plantefeve, Tapponnier, Jonas, Ngapmen, Le Guennec, De Roquetaillade, Argaud, Jamme, Goulenok, Merouani, Leclerc, Sauneuf, Shidasp, Stoclin, Bardet, Mir, Ibrahimi and Llitjos.",2022,//,Frontiers in Oncology,12,,858276-858276,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.858276,,#67898,H 2022,"Justine Chan (2023-10-28 03:46:55)(Select): All-cause inpatient fatalities included death as a direct result of

Characterizing cancer and COVID-19 outcomes using electronic health records,"Y., Kim; L., Zhu; H., Zhu; X., Li; Y., Huang; C., Gu; H., Bush; C., Chung; , Zhang G.-Q.","Purpose Patients with cancer often have compromised immune system which can lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess the association between COVID-19 outcomes and existing cancer-specific characteristics. Patients and methods Patients aged 18 or older with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were identified (n = 314 004) from the Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record (EHR) derived from more than 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the United States. To allow sufficient observational time, patients with less than one year of medical history in the EHR dataset before their COVID-19 tests were excluded (n = 42 365). Assessed COVID-19 outcomes including all-cause 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, and ventilator use, which were compared using relative risks (RRs) according to cancer status and treatments. Results Among 271 639 patients with COVID-19, 18 460 had at least one cancer diagnosis: 8034 with a history of cancer and 10 426 with newly diagnosed cancer within one year of COVID-19 infection. Patients with a cancer diagnosis were older and more likely to be male, white, Medicare beneficiaries, and have higher prevalences of chronic conditions. Cancer patients had higher risks for 30-day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.028) and hospitalization (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P = 0.006) but without significant differences in ICU admission and ventilator use compared to non-cancer patients. Recent cancer diagnoses were associated with higher risks for worse COVID-19 outcomes (RR for mortality 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.25, P<0.001 and RR for hospitalization 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14, P<0.001), particularly among recent metastatic (stage IV), hematological, liver and lung cancers compared with the non-cancer group. Among COVID-19 patients with recent cancer diagnosis, mortality was associated with chemotherapy or radiation treatments within 3 months before COVID-19. Age, black patients, Medicare recipients, South geographic region, cardiovascular, diabetes, liver, and renal diseases were also associated with increased mortality. Conclusions and relevance Individuals with cancer had higher risks for 30-day mortality and hospitalization after SARSCoV-2 infection compared to patients without cancer. More specifically, patients with a cancer diagnosis within 1 year and those receiving active treatment were more vulnerable to worse COVID-19 outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Kim et al.

Changing characteristics of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,"R., Korkusuz; G.S., Erdal; I.K., Akilli; M., Bilge; D., Tural; , Yasar K K","Introduction: Cancer patients are more sensitive to infections, and, compared to other patients, may have more serious outcomes. Thus, cancer patients are a high-risk group in the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate how cancer patients are affected by COVID-19 infection; the prevalence, and factors affecting mortality. Methodology: This single-centre, retrospective study included cancer patients under follow-up treatment at our hospital with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. The effects of tumour subtype and patient demographic data on COVID-19 prevalence and mortality were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. Result(s): Evaluation was made of 217 cancer patients, comprising 140 (64.5%) males and 77 (35.5%) females with a mean age of 62.05 +/- 12.95 years. Mortality was seen in 84 (38.7%) patients. Disease grade, chemotherapy within the last 3 months and CT findings were determined to be related to mortality. In logistic regression analysis, the most important factors affecting survival were determined to be severe lung involvement (p < 0.001) and hematological malignancy. Conclusion(s): It is clear that cancer patients are at greater risk from COVID-19 infection than individuals without a malignant disease. The results showed that cancer patients with different tumour types had different levels of sensitivity to COVID-19. It is clear that with ongoing viral mutations, the duration of the pandemic is unknown. Therefore, the continuation of cancer screening and cancer treatments should not be interrupted.Copyright © 2022 Korkusuz et al.

Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality and the need for intensive care in hospitalized non-critical COVID-19 patients: a prospective cohort study,"N.C., Basaran; M., Ozdede; O.A., Uyaroglu; T.K., Sahin; B., Ozcan; H., Oral; L., Ozisik; G.S., Guven; Tanriover M.D.  AO  - Ozdede, Murat; ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6981-1210","One of the most helpful strategies to deal with ongoing coronavirus pandemics is to use some prudence when treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to evaluate the clinical, demographic, and laboratory parameters that might have predictive value for in-hospital mortality and the need for intensive care and build a model based on them. This study was a prospective, observational, single-center study including non-critical patients admitted to COVID-19 wards. Besides classical clinic-demographic features, basic laboratory parameters obtained on admission were tested, and then new models for each outcome were developed built on the most significant variables. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed by calculating each model's probability. A total of 368 non-critical hospitalized patients were recruited, the need for ICU care was observed in 70 patients (19%). The total number of patients who died in either ICU or wards was 39 (10.6%). The first two models (based on clinical features and demographics) were developed to predict ICU and death, respectively; older age, male sex, active cancer, and low baseline saturation were noted to be independent predictors. The area under the curve values of the first two models were noted 0.878 and 0.882 (p<.001; confidence interval [CI] 95% [0.837-0.919], p<.001; CI 95% [0.844-0.922]). Following two models, the third and fourth were based on laboratory parameters with clinic-demographic features. Initial lower sodium and lower albumin levels were determined as independent factors in predicting the need for ICU care; higher blood urea nitrogen and lower albumin were independent factors in predicting in-hospital mortality. The area under the curve values of the third and fourth model was noted 0.938 and 0.929, respectively (p<.001; CI 95% [0.912-0.965], p<.001; CI 95% [0.895-962]). By integrating the widely available blood tests results with simple clinic demographic data, non-critical patients can be stratified according to their risk level. Such stratification is essential to filter the patients' non-critical underlying diseases and conditions that can obfuscate the physician's predictive capacity.Copyright © 2022.

High mortality in patients with active malignancy and severe COVID-19: Results from an Austrian multicenter registry during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic,"S., Udovica; N., Muser; A., Pechlaner; A., Reichinger; C., Aichinger; K., Strasser-Weippl; H., Rumpold; A., Petzer; E., Woll; W., Hilbe; Muldur E.  AO  - Udovica, Simon; ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6490-4568","Background: Various registries of patients with cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged over the last few months and patients with cancer are reported to be at increased risk for severe outcome of COVID-19. Yet, many studies lack a direct control group and include patients with different baseline parameters. Here we report data for patients with active malignancy who were hospitalized for severe COVID-19 and a control group hospitalized with severe COVID-19, but not diagnosed with ongoing malignant disease. Moreover, we incorporate the prognostic 4C Mortality Score which estimates in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. Method(s): In all, 245 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021 were included in the analysis. Among those, 89 patients were diagnosed with active malignancy. Primary endpoint was COVID-19-associated mortality. Result(s): COVID-19-associated mortality was significantly higher in cancer patients than in the control group (46.1 vs. 27.6%, odds ratio [OR] 2.56, p< 0.001). In multivariable analysis, diagnosis of active malignancy (OR 4.59) and poor ECOG status >=3 (OR 6.56) were the strongest predictors of COVID-19-related death. The prognostic 4C Mortality Score correctly predicted mortality in the control group (occurred: 27.6%, vs. estimated: 27.3%, p> 0.999), but significantly underestimated COVID-19-related mortality in cancer patients (occurred: 46.1% vs. estimated: 32.2%, p= 0.003). Conclusion(s): Active malignancy was associated with high mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality rate was underestimated by the 4C Mortality Score.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2022,//,Memo - Magazine of European Medical Oncology,15,2,153-160,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12254-022-00814-9,,#68513,S 2022,"Anita Patel (2023-11-03 21:54:04)(Select): cancer patients treated in an ICU more often required mechanical ventilation (75.0 vs. 43.5%, p= 0.01) and their mortality was significantly higher than that of patients without cancer (68.8 vs 13.0%, p< 0.001; Fig. 3)

"Comorbidities associated with mortality in 31,461 adults with COVID-19 in the United States: A federated electronic medical record analysis","S.L., Harrison; E., Fazio-Eynullayeva; D.A., Lane; P., Underhill; , Lip G Y H","Background: At the beginning of June 2020, there were nearly 7 million reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide and over 400,000 deaths in people with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine associations between comorbidities listed in the Charlson comorbidity index and mortality among patients in the United States with COVID-19. Methods and findings: A retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 from 24 healthcare organizations in the US was conducted. The study included adults aged 18-90 years with COVID-19 coded in their electronic medical records between January 20, 2020, and May 26, 2020. Results were also stratified by age groups (<50 years, 50-69 years, or 70-90 years). A total of 31,461 patients were included. Median age was 50 years (interquartile range [IQR], 35-63) and 54.5% (n = 17,155) were female. The most common comorbidities listed in the Charlson comorbidity index were chronic pulmonary disease (17.5%, n = 5,513) and diabetes mellitus (15.0%, n = 4,710). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed older age (odds ratio [OR] per year 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.07; p < 0.001), male sex (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.55-1.98; p < 0.001), being black or African American compared to white (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.31-1.71; p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.64-2.35; p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.21-1.67; p < 0.001), dementia (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.56; p = 0.008), chronic pulmonary disease (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08-1.43; p = 0.003), mild liver disease (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.00-1.59; p = 0.046), moderate/ severe liver disease (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.53-4.47; p < 0.001), renal disease (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.84-2.46; p < 0.001), and metastatic solid tumor (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.19-2.43; p = 0.004) were associated with higher odds of mortality with COVID-19. Older age, male sex, and being black or African American (compared to being white) remained significantly associated with higher odds of death in age-stratified analyses. There were differences in which comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality between age groups. Limitations include that the data were collected from the healthcare organization electronic medical record databases and some comorbidities may be underreported and ethnicity was unknown for 24% of participants. Deaths during an inpatient or outpatient visit at the participating healthcare organizations were recorded; however, deaths occurring outside of the hospital setting are not well captured. Conclusion(s): Identifying patient characteristics and conditions associated with mortality with COVID-19 is important for hypothesis generating for clinical trials and to develop targeted intervention strategies.Copyright: © 2020 Harrison et al.

Here, we evaluated COVID-19 infection outcomes and mortality in thyroid cancer patients with COVID-19 infection. Design and methods: We included a cohort of patients with thyroid cancer with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 disease from 11 March to 30 May 2020 from the Turkish Ministry of Health database in our nationwide, retrospective study. We compared the mortality and morbidity of COVID patients with or without thyroid cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the independent factors for mortality, length of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. We also analysed the effect of radioiodine treatment on severity and death rate of COVID-19 disease. Result(s): We evaluated 388 COVID-19 patients with thyroid cancer [median age: 54 years, interquartile range (IQR) 18 years, males: 23%] and age and gender-matched 388 COVID-19 patients without thyroid cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer had a similar mortality ratio compared with the non-cancer group. Among patients with thyroid cancer, age, presence of diabetes mellitus, asthma/COPD, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, prior coronary artery disease, RAS blocker usage and low lymphocyte count were associated with mortality. Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment and cumulative radioactive iodine dosage did not negatively affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease in our patient group. Conclusion(s): Our study indicated that history of thyroid cancer did not have an increased risk of mortality or morbidity in COVID-19 disease. Besides, RAI therapy history and doses of radioactive iodine did not affect mortality or outcome.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,//,Clinical Endocrinology,95,4,628-637,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cen.14486,,#69975,Sahin 2021,"",cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); true cancer vs non-cancer

Method(s): A population-based study was thus conducted in Friuli Venezia Giulia region, northeastern Italy, to estimate prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection among cancer patients, as compared to cancer-free individuals, and to evaluate adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 263,042 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February-December 2020 with cancer history retrieved through the regional cancer registry. Odds ratios (ORs) of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for sex and age. Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for sex and age for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and all-cause death were estimated using Cox models. Result(s): Among 26,394 cancer patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, the prevalence of infection was 11.7% versus 16.2% among 236,648 cancer-free individuals, with a corresponding OR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.57-0.62). The prevalence was much higher (29% in both groups) during the second pandemic wave (October-December 2020). Among cancer patients, age >=80 years and cancer diagnosis >=13 months before SARS-CoV-2 testing were the major risk factors of infection. Among 3098 infected cancer patients, the fatality rate was 17.4% versus 15.8% among 23,296 negative ones (HR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.49-1.78), and versus 5.0% among 38,268 infected cancer-free individuals (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.12-1.36). No significant differences emerged when considering ICU admission risk. Conclusion(s): Albeit cancer patients reported reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, those infected showed higher mortality than uninfected ones and infected cancer-free population. Study findings claim for continuing to protect cancer patients from SARS-CoV-2, without reducing the level of oncologic care.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

The objective was to assess COVID-19 mortality rates in patients with cancer versus patients without cancer and uncover possible statistically significant characteristics contributing to mortality. Method(s): This retrospective study analyzed patients with cancer and patients without cancer who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 1 through April 30, 2020. This was a multicenter study in the state of Louisiana throughout the Ochsner Health System in both tertiary and nontertiary centers. Patients older than 18 years were eligible. Three hundred twelve patients with cancer were compared with 4833 patients without cancer. Result(s): Mortality was found to be higher in the cancer group. Patients of advanced age with cancer had a significant increase in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; P <.001). Other significant risk factors for increased mortality were male sex (OR, 2.15), a history of chronic kidney disease (OR, 3.84), and obesity (OR, 1.30). In hospitalized patients with cancer, adverse vital signs on admission, decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, lactic acidosis, and elevated procalcitonin all seemed to increase the risk of death. Among patients with cancer, active or progressive disease (P <.001) and recent therapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.08) were shown to increase mortality. Conclusion(s): Patients with cancer have increased mortality in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer who are 65 years of age or older and those with certain comorbidities have the greatest risk of death. Recent cancer-directed therapy and disease status also seem to play roles in mortality. Lay Summary: This is the largest study of patients with cancer versus patients without cancer to date and is the first multivariate analysis study comparing these 2 patient populations. This study confirms the hypothesis that patients with cancer are at increased risk for mortality and that there are multiple characteristics posing the potential to risk-stratify these patients in the setting of a future outbreak.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",2021,//,Cancer,127,2,266-274,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33243,,#70002,M 2021,"Mark Cheng (2023-12-02 20:54:25)(Included): James: cancer comorbidity was defined as anywhere within the record however recent therapy cohort was defined as rx within 30 days of positive covid test - use the latter for the cancer cohort in data extraction and the non cancer cohort for the non cancer cohort (dont include non-active cancer) - note we will not be able to record comorbidities of the recent therapy cohort but they are included in the MV regression so some degree of controlling for confounding.

Risk factors for severity on admission and the disease progression during hospitalisation in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Japan,"M., Terada; H., Ohtsu; S., Saito; K., Hayakawa; S., Tsuzuki; Y., Asai; N., Matsunaga; S., Kutsuna; W., Sugiura; , Ohmagari N; Terada, Mari; Ohtsu, Hiroshi; Saito, Sho; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Tsuzuki, Shinya; Asai, Yusuke; Matsunaga, Nobuaki; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Sugiura, Wataru; Ohmagari, Norio","Objectives To investigate the risk factors contributing to severity on admission. Additionally, risk factors of worst severity and fatality were studied. Moreover, factors were compared based on three points: early severity, worst severity and fatality. Design An observational cohort study using data entered in a Japan nationwide COVID-19 inpatient registry, COVIREGI-JP. Setting As of 28 September 2020, 10480 cases from 802 facilities have been registered. Participating facilities cover a wide range of hospitals where patients with COVID-19 are admitted in Japan. Participants Participants who had a positive test result on any applicable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were admitted to participating healthcare facilities. A total of 3829 cases were identified from 16 January to 31 May 2020, of which 3376 cases were included in this study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcome was severe or nonsevere on admission, determined by the requirement of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, SpO2 or respiratory rate. Secondary outcome was the worst severity during hospitalisation, judged by the requirement of oxygen and/orinvasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Results Risk factors for severity on admission were older age, men, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease or dialysis, solid tumour and hyperlipidaemia did not influence severity on admission; however, it influenced worst severity. Fatality rates for obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were relatively lower. Conclusions This study segregated the comorbidities influencing severity and death. It is possible that risk factors for severity on admission, worst severity and fatality are not consistent and may be propelled by different factors. Specifically, while hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity had major effect on worst severity, their impact was mild on fatality in the Japanese population. Some studies contradict our results; therefore, detailed analyses, considering in-hospital treatments, are needed for validation.

We investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We identified patients with a history of cancer admitted to two large hospitals between March 13, 2020, and May 10, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched them 1:2 to patients without a history of cancer. Result(s): Men made up 56.2% of the population, with a median age of 69 years (range, 30-96). The median time since cancer diagnosis was 35.6 months (range, 0.39-435); 80% had a solid tumor, and 20% had a hematologic malignancy. Among patients with cancer, 27.8% died or entered hospice versus 25.6% among patients without cancer. In multivariable analyses, the odds of death/hospice were similar (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.82). The odds of intubation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.78), shock (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91), and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81) were lower for patients with a history of cancer versus controls. Patients with active cancer or who had received cancer-directed therapy in the past 6 months had similar odds of death/hospice compared with cancer survivors (univariable OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.66-2.60; multivariable OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.69-3.16). Conclusion(s): Patients with a history of cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 had similar mortality to matched hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without cancer, and a lower risk of complications. In this population, patients with active cancer or recent cancer treatment had a similar risk for adverse outcomes compared with survivors of cancer. Implications for Practice: This study investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death or hospice admission in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Active cancer, systemic cancer therapy, and a cancer history are not independent risk factors for death from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, and hospitalized patients without cancer are more likely to have severe COVID-19. These findings provide reassurance to survivors of cancer and patients with cancer as to their relative risk of severe COVID-19, may encourage oncologists to provide standard anticancer therapy in patients at risk of COVID-19, and guide triage in future waves of infection.Copyright © 2021 AlphaMed Press.",2021,//,Oncologist,26,8,685-693,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/onco.13794,,#70019,Klein 2021,"Long Hei Fong (2023-12-01 21:18:10)(Included): Primary outcome is defined as ""mortality OR admission to hospice.

Method(s): We analysed 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and haematological malignancies. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared to a matched control group of 53 non-cancer patients with COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with poor outcome. Result(s): The most frequent haematological diseases were lymphoma (30%) and multiple myeloma (30%). Eighty-seven % HP developed moderate or severe disease. Patients with haematological malignancies had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (35.9% vs 13.2%; P =.003 (odds ratio 6.652). The worst outcome was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. Only age >70 years and C reactive protein >10 mg/dl at admission were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio 34.86, P =.003 and 13.56,P =.03). Persistent viral sheddind was detected in 5 HP. Active chemotherapy, viral load at diagnosis and COVID-19 therapy were not predictors of outcome. Conclusion(s): Mortality of COVID-19 is significantly higher in patients with haematological malignancies compared to non-cancer patients. The impact of persistent viral shedding must be considered in order to re-start therapies and maintain infectious control measures.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We present characteristics, interventions and longer term outcomes of the entire, unselected cohort of all ICU patients with COVID-19 in Denmark where the ICU capacity was not exceeded. Method(s): We identified all patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to any Danish ICU from 10 March to 19 May 2020 and registered demographics, chronic comorbidities, use of organ support, length of stay, and vital status from patient files. Risk factors for death were analyzed using adjusted Cox regression analysis. Result(s): There were 323 ICU patients with confirmed COVID-19. Median age was 68 years, 74% were men, 50% had hypertension, 21% diabetes, and 20% chronic pulmonary disease; 29% had no chronic comorbidity. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 82%, vasopressors in 83%, renal replacement therapy in 26%, and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation in 8%. ICU stay was median 13 days (IQR 6-22) and hospital stay 19 days (11-30). Median follow-up was 79 days. At end of follow-up, 118 had died (37%), 15 (4%) were still in hospital hereof 4 in ICU as of 16 June 2020. Risk factors for mortality included male gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease, active cancer, and number of co-morbidities.

Risk prediction of covid-19 related death or hospital admission in adults testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the omicron wave in England (QCOVID4): cohort study,Hippisley-Cox J.; Khunti K.; Sheikh A.; Nguyen-Van-Tam J.S.; Coupland C.A.C. ,"Objectives: To derive and validate risk prediction algorithms (QCOVID4) to estimate the risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission in people with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the period when the omicron variant of the virus was predominant in England, and to evaluate performance compared with a high risk cohort from NHS Digital. Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): QResearch database linked to English national data on covid-19 vaccinations, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospital admissions, and cancer and mortality data, 11 December 2021 to 31 March 2022, with follow-up to 30 June 2022. Participant(s): 1.3 million adults in the derivation cohort and 0.15 million adults in the validation cohort, aged 18-100 years, with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary outcome was covid-19 related death and secondary outcome was hospital admission for covid-19. Risk equations with predictor variables were derived from models fitted in the derivation cohort. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort. Result(s): Of 1 297 922 people with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the derivation cohort, 18 756 (1.5%) had a covid-19 related hospital admission and 3878 (0.3%) had a covid-19 related death during follow-up. The final QCOVID4 models included age, deprivation score and a range of health and sociodemographic factors, number of covid-19 vaccinations, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of death related to covid-19 was lower among those who had received a covid-19 vaccine, with evidence of a dose-response relation (42% risk reduction associated with one vaccine dose and 92% reduction with four or more doses in men). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a reduction in the risk of covid-19 related death (49% reduction in men). The QCOVID4 algorithm for covid-19 explained 76.0% (95% confidence interval 73.9% to 78.2%) of the variation in time to covid-19 related death in men with a D statistic of 3.65 (3.43 to 3.86) and Harrell's C statistic of 0.970 (0.962 to 0.979). Results were similar for women. QCOVID4 was well calibrated. QCOVID4 was substantially more efficient than the NHS Digital algorithm for correctly identifying patients at high risk of covid-19 related death. Of the 461 covid-19 related deaths in the validation cohort, 333 (72.2%) were in the QCOVID4 high risk group and 95 (20.6%) in the NHS Digital high risk group. Conclusion(s): The QCOVID4 risk algorithm, modelled from data during the period when the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was predominant in England, now includes vaccination dose and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and predicted covid-19 related death among people with a positive test result. QCOVID4 more accurately identified individuals at the highest levels of absolute risk for targeted interventions than the approach adopted by NHS Digital. QCOVID4 performed well and could be used for targeting treatments for covid-19 disease. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY. No commercial re-use.

There is limited information describing the outcomes of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Methods: We utilized the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2020 database to collect information on cancer patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the United States. Using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) coding system, adult (>=18 years) patients with COVID-19 were identified. Adjusted analyses were performed to assess for mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization among cancer patients. Results: A total of 1,050,045 patients were included. Of them, 27,760 had underlying cancer. Cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities. The all-cause in-hospital mortality rate in cancer patients was 17.58% vs. 11% in non-cancer. After adjusted logistic regression, cancer patients had a 21% increase in the odds of all-cause in-hospital mortality compared with those without cancer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.21, 95%CI 1.12-1.31, p-value < 0.001). Additionally, an increased odds in acute respiratory failure rate was found (aOR 1.14, 95%CI 1.06-1.22, p-value < 0.001). However, no significant differences were found in the odds of septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mechanical ventilation between the two groups.

One-year mortality in COVID-19 is associated with patients' comorbidities rather than pneumonia severity.,"Novelli, Luca; Raimondi, Federico; Carioli, Greta; Carobbio, Alessandra; Pappacena, Simone; Biza, Roberta; Trapasso, Roberta; Anelli, Marisa; Amoroso, Mariangela; Allegri, Chiara; Malandrino, Luca; Imeri, Gianluca; Conti, Caterina; Beretta, Marta; Gori, Mauro; D'Elia, Emilia; Senni, Michele; Lorini, Ferdinando Luca; Rizzi, Marco; Cosentini, Roberto; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Masciulli, Arianna; Gavazzi, Antonello; Solidoro, Paolo; Sironi, Sandro; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Barbui, Tiziano; Marco, Fabiano Di","BACKGROUND: In patients with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome who survived hospitalization, one-year mortality can affect up to one third of discharged patients. Therefore, significant long-term mortality after COVID-19 respiratory failure could be expected. The primary outcome of the present study was one-year all-cause mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Observational study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital (Bergamo, Italy), during the first pandemic wave., RESULTS: A total of 1326 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. Overall one-year mortality was 33.6% (N 446/1326), with the majority of deaths occurring during hospitalization (N=412, 92.4%). Thirty-four patients amongst the 914 discharged (3.7%) subsequentely died within one year. A third of these patients died for advanced cancer, while death without a cause other than COVID-19 was uncommon (8.8% of the overall post-discharge mortality). In-hospital late mortality (i.e. after 28 days of admission) interested a population with a lower age, and fewer comorbidities, more frequentely admitted in ICU. Independent predictors of post-discharge mortality were age over 65 years (HR 3.19; 95% CI 1.28-7.96, p-value=0.013), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR 2.52; 95% CI 1.09-5.83, p-value=0.031) or proxy of cardiovascular disease (HR 4.93; 95% CI 1.45-16.75, p-value=0.010), and presence of active cancer (HR 3.64; 95% CI 1.50-8.84, p-value=0.004), but not pneumonia severity., CONCLUSIONS: One-year post-discharge mortality depends on underlying patients' comorbidities rather than COVID-19 pneumonia severity per se.

Early COVID-19 Hospitalizations Among New York State Residents with a History of Invasive Cancer.,"Zhang, Xiuling; Gates Kuliszewski, Margaret; Kahn, Amy R; Schymura, Maria J","Background: Individuals with a history of cancer may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 due to immunosuppression, comorbidities, or ongoing treatment. We linked inpatient claims data on COVID-19 hospitalizations to cancer diagnoses from the New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR) to examine associations between prior cancer diagnoses and hospitalizations for COVID-19, and factors associated with death at discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization., Methods: New York State (NYS) residents diagnosed with invasive cancer before July 1, 2021, who were alive on January 1, 2020, were identified from NYSCR data. We obtained claims data for discharge year 2020 and the first half of 2021 from NYS's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), and we linked inpatient records with COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis to cancer data from the NYSCR using deterministic matching methods. We calculated descriptive statistics and conducted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses to examine associations of cancer case characteristics with COVID-19 hospitalization and with vital status at discharge among patients with a history of cancer. All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4., Results: Our analysis included 1,257,377 individuals with a history of cancer, 10,210 of whom had a subsequent primary COVID-19 hospitalization. Individuals with a history of cancer were 16% more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to the general population of NYS, after adjusting for age and sex (95% CI, 14%-19%). Factors independently associated with COVID-19 hospitalization among cancer patients included older age, male sex, non-Hispanic Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, diagnosis with late-stage cancer or with multiple tumors, more recent cancer diagnosis, and New York City (NYC) residency at the time of cancer diagnosis. Factors independently associated with death at discharge among individuals with COVID-19 hospitalization and a prior cancer diagnosis included older age, male sex, non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander race or Hispanic ethnicity, residence in NYC at the time of COVID-19 hospitalization, and an active cancer diagnosis claim code at the time of COVID-19 hospitalization., Conclusion: This claims-based study identified higher risks of COVID-19 hospitalization and death at discharge among individuals with a history of cancer, and particularly those in certain demographic and diagnostic groups.

Of these, 52,019 tested positive for COVID-19 of whom 13,752 had a cancer diagnosis. We conducted Firth-corrected logistic regression to assess the association between cancer status, site, treatment, vaccination, and four COVID-19 outcomes: hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mortality, and a composite ""severe COVID"" outcome., RESULTS: Cancer diagnosis was significantly associated with higher rates of severe COVID, hospitalization, and mortality. These associations were driven by patients whose most recent initial cancer diagnosis was within the past 3 years. Chemotherapy receipt, colorectal cancer, hematologic malignancies, kidney cancer, and lung cancer were significantly associated with higher rates of worse COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccinations were significantly associated with lower rates of worse COVID-19 outcomes regardless of cancer status., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with colorectal cancer, hematologic malignancies, kidney cancer, or lung cancer or who receive chemotherapy for treatment should be cautious because of their increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes, even after vaccination., IMPACT: Additional COVID-19 precautions are warranted for people with certain cancer types and treatments. Significant benefit from vaccination is noted for both cancer and cancer-free patients.

In-hospital mortality and ICU admission were predicted from current and past cancer diagnoses. Moderation by patient characteristics, vaccination status, cancer type, and year of the pandemic was examined., RESULTS: 6.8% of the patients had current (n = 7,141) and 6.5% had past (n = 6,749) cancer diagnoses. Current cancer predicted both severe outcomes but past cancer did not; adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for mortality were 1.58 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.46-1.70] and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.96-1.13), respectively. Mortality rates decreased over the pandemic but the incremental risk of current cancer persisted, with the increment being larger among younger vs. older patients. Prior COVID-19 vaccination reduced mortality generally and among those with current cancer (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.90)., CONCLUSIONS: Current cancer, especially among younger patients, posed a substantially increased risk for death and ICU admission among patients with COVID-19; prior COVID-19 vaccination mitigated the risk associated with current cancer. Past history of cancer was not associated with higher risks for severe COVID-19 outcomes for most cancer types., IMPACT: This study clarifies the characteristics that modify the risk associated with cancer on severe COVID-19 outcomes across the first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalised immunocompromised patients: An analysis of the WHO ISARIC CCP-UK prospective cohort study.,"Turtle, Lance; Thorpe, Mathew; Drake, Thomas M; Swets, Maaike; Palmieri, Carlo; Russell, Clark D; Ho, Antonia; Aston, Stephen; Wootton, Daniel G; Richter, Alex; de Silva, Thushan I; Hardwick, Hayley E; Leeming, Gary; Law, Andy; Openshaw, Peter J M; Harrison, Ewen M; Baillie, J Kenneth; Semple, Malcolm G; Docherty, Annemarie B","BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients may be at higher risk of mortality if hospitalised with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with immunocompetent patients. However, previous studies have been contradictory. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients were at greater risk of in-hospital death and how this risk changed over the pandemic., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients > = 19 years with symptomatic community-acquired COVID-19 recruited to the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK prospective cohort study. We defined immunocompromise as immunosuppressant medication preadmission, cancer treatment, organ transplant, HIV, or congenital immunodeficiency. We used logistic regression to compare the risk of death in both groups, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, vaccination, and comorbidities. We used Bayesian logistic regression to explore mortality over time. Between 17 January 2020 and 28 February 2022, we recruited 156,552 eligible patients, of whom 21,954 (14%) were immunocompromised. In total, 29% (n = 6,499) of immunocompromised and 21% (n = 28,608) of immunocompetent patients died in hospital. The odds of in-hospital mortality were elevated for immunocompromised patients (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI [1.39, 1.50], p < 0.001). Not all immunocompromising conditions had the same risk, for example, patients on active cancer treatment were less likely to have their care escalated to intensive care (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI [0.7, 0.85], p < 0.001) or ventilation (adjusted OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.56, 0.76], p < 0.001). However, cancer patients were more likely to die (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI [1.87, 2.15], p < 0.001). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, comorbidities, and vaccination status. As the pandemic progressed, in-hospital mortality reduced more slowly for immunocompromised patients than for immunocompetent patients. This was particularly evident with increasing age: the probability of the reduction in hospital mortality being less for immunocompromised patients aged 50 to 69 years was 88% for men and 83% for women, and for those >80 years was 99% for men and 98% for women. The study is limited by a lack of detailed drug data prior to admission, including steroid doses, meaning that we may have incorrectly categorised some immunocompromised patients as immunocompetent., CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised patients remain at elevated risk of death from COVID-19. Targeted measures such as additional vaccine doses, monoclonal antibodies, and nonpharmaceutical preventive interventions should be continually encouraged for this patient group., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 66726260.

Patients with cancer were more likely to be pancytopenic and have a smoking history, pulmonary disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and corticosteroid use in the preceding 2 wk (p<=0.01). In addition, they were more likely to present with higher inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, and procalcitonin) but were less likely to present with clinical symptoms (p<=0.01). By country-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses, cancer was not found to be an independent risk factor for 30 day mortality (p=0.18), whereas lymphopenia was independently associated with increased mortality in all patients and in patients with cancer. Older age (>=65y) was the strongest predictor of 30 day mortality in all patients (OR = 4.47, p<0.0001). Remdesivir was the only therapeutic agent independently associated with decreased 30 day mortality (OR = 0.64, p=0.036). Among patients on low-flow oxygen at admission, patients who received remdesivir had a lower 30 day mortality rate than those who did not (5.9 vs 17.6%; p=0.03)., Conclusions: Increased 30 day all-cause mortality from COVID-19 was not independently associated with cancer but was independently associated with lymphopenia often observed in hematolgic malignancy. Remdesivir, particularly in patients with cancer receiving low-flow oxygen, can reduce 30 day all-cause mortality., Funding: National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health.

We conducted this retrospective study in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to find differences in inflammatory markers and mortality in cancer patients compared to others., METHODS: We reviewed the electronic records of patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR from March to September 2020. Data on socio-demographics, comorbidities, inflammatory makers, and cancer-related features were analyzed., RESULTS: 2,772 patients were admitted for SARS-CoV-2, to the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal in Madrid during this period. Of these, 2,527 (91%) had no history of neoplastic disease, 164 (5.9%) patients had a prior history of cancer but were not undergoing oncological treatment at the time of infection, and 81 (2.9%) were in active treatment. Mortality in patients without a history of cancer was 19.5%, 28.6% for patients with a prior history of cancer, and 34% in patients with active cancer treatment. Patients in active oncology treatment with the highest mortality rate were those diagnosed with lung cancer (OR 5.6 95% CI: 2.2-14.1). In the multivariate study, active oncological treatment (OR 2.259 95% CI: 1.35-3.77) and chemotherapy treatment (OR 3.624 95% CI: 1.17-11.17), were statistically significant factors for the risk of death for the whole group and for the group with active oncological treatment, respectively., CONCLUSION: Cancer patients on active systemic treatment have an increased risk of mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially with lung cancer or chemotherapy treatment.

Data were collected from December 15, 2020, through February 28, 2022., Exposures: Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, immunocompromised status, and vaccination-related variables., Main Outcomes and Measures: Development of severe vs nonsevere SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe disease was defined as hospitalization within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and either blood oxygen level of less than 94%, receipt of supplemental oxygen or dexamethasone, mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days. Association between severe disease and exposures was estimated using logistic regression models., Results: Among 110760 patients with infections following vaccination (97614 [88.1%] men, mean [SD] age at vaccination, 60.8 [15.3] years; 26953 [24.3%] Black, 11259 [10.2%] Hispanic, and 71665 [64.7%] White), 10612 (9.6%) had severe COVID-19. The strongest association with risk of severe disease after vaccination was age, which increased among patients aged 50 years or older with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.42 (CI, 1.40-1.44) per 5-year increase in age, such that patients aged 80 years or older had an aOR of 16.58 (CI, 13.49-20.37) relative to patients aged 45 to 50 years. Immunocompromising conditions, including receipt of different classes of immunosuppressive medications (eg, leukocyte inhibitor: aOR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.39-3.28) or cytotoxic chemotherapy (aOR, 2.71; CI, 2.27-3.24) prior to breakthrough infection, or leukemias or lymphomas (aOR, 1.87; CI, 1.61-2.17) and chronic conditions associated with end-organ disease, such as heart failure (aOR, 1.74; CI, 1.61-1.88), dementia (aOR, 2.01; CI, 1.83-2.20), and chronic kidney disease (aOR, 1.59; CI, 1.49-1.69), were also associated with increased risk. Receipt of an additional (ie, booster) dose of vaccine was associated with reduced odds of severe disease (aOR, 0.50; CI, 0.44-0.57)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this nationwide, retrospective cohort of predominantly male US Veterans, we identified risk factors associated with severe disease despite vaccination.

Amongst risk factors proposed, a diagnosis of cancer has been worrisome. We report the impact of cancer and other risk factors in US Veterans receiving care at Veterans Administration (VA) Hospitals, their adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for infection and death, and report on the impact of vaccines on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections in Veterans without/with cancer., METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of US Veterans without/with cancer by mining VA COVID-19 Shared Data Resource (CSDR) data using the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). Our observation period includes index dates from 14DEC2020 to 25JAN2022, encompassing both the delta and omicron waves in the US., RESULTS: We identified 915,928 Veterans, 24% of whom were African Americans who had undergone COVID testing-688,541 were and 227,387 were not vaccinated. 157,072 had a cancer diagnosis in the preceding two years. Age emerged as the major risk factor, with gender, BMI, and (Elixhauser) comorbidity contributing less. Among veterans with solid tumors other than lung cancer, risks of infection and death within 60 days were comparable to Veterans without cancer. However, those with hematologic malignancies fared worse. Vaccination was highly effective across all cancer cohorts; the respective rates of infection and death after infection were 8% and 5% among the vaccinated compared to 47% and 10% in the unvaccinated. Amongst vaccinated, increased risk of infection was noted in both, Veterans with hematologic malignancy treated with chemotherapy (HR, 2.993, P < 0.0001) or targeted therapies (HR, 1.781, P < 0.0001), and in solid tumors treated with either chemotherapy (HR 2.328, 95%CI 2.075-2.611, P < 0.0001) or targeted therapies (HR 1.328, P < 0.0001) when compared to those not on treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Risk for COVID-19 infection and death from infection vary based on cancer type and therapies administered. Importantly and encouragingly, the duration of protection from infection following vaccination in Veterans with a diagnosis of cancer was remarkably like those without a cancer diagnosis.

The clinical characteristics and risk factors for severe progression were assessed and subclassified according to vaccination status., RESULTS: A total of 438 COVID-19 patients were included; the numbers of patients in the unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated groups were 188 (42.9%), 117 (26.7%) and 133 (30.4%), respectively. The vaccinated group was older, less symptomatic and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index at presentation. The proportions of patients who experienced severe progression in the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated groups were 20.3% (31/153) and 10.8% (13/120), respectively. Older age, diabetes mellitus, solid cancer, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and chest X-ray abnormalities were associated with severe progression, and the vaccination at least once was the only protective factor for severe progression. Chest X-ray abnormalities at presentation were the only predictor for severe progression among fully vaccinated patients., CONCLUSION: In the hospitalized setting, vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients showed different clinical features and risk of oxygen demand despite a relatively high proportion of patients in the two groups. Vaccination needs to be assessed as an initial checkpoint, and chest X-ray may be helpful for predicting severe progression in vaccinated patients.

Patients with cancer undergoing potentially immunosuppressive therapies appear to be at particular risk for the disease and its complications. Here, we describe the experience of patients with cancer within Kaiser Permanente, a large, integrated health system in Northern California. Between February 25, 2020, and June 8, 2020, 4,627 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 33 had active cancer treatment within 180 days and 214 had a history of cancer. Patients with active cancer treatment had a statistically higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 2.57; confidence interval [CI], 1.10-6.01), and there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk of death (OR, 2.78; CI, 0.92-8.43).

Method(s): Prospective observational cohort study on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 disease in February-24th/May-17th 2020 in Milan, Italy. Uni-multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed. Death's percentage by two-weeks' intervals according to age and disease severity was analysed. Result(s): A total of 174/539 (32.3%) patients died in hospital over 8228 person-day follow-up; the 14-day Kaplan-Meier probability of death was 29.5% (95%CI: 25.5-34.0). Older age, burden of comorbidities, COVID-19 disease severity, inflammatory markers at admission were independent predictors of increased risk, while several drug-combinations were predictors of reduced risk of in-hospital death. The highest fatality rate, 36.5%, occurred during the 2nd-3rd week of March, when 55.4% of patients presented with severe disease, while a second peak, by the end of April, was related to the admission of older patients (55% >=80 years) with less severe disease, 30% coming from long-term care facilities. Conclusion(s): The unusual fatality rate in our setting is likely to be related to age and the clinical conditions of our patients.

Many foci worldwide have been identified in retirement nursing homes, with a high number of deaths. Our study aims were to evaluate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the retirement nursing homes, the predictors to develop symptoms, and death. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all people living in retirement nursing homes (PLRNH), where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Medical and clinical data were collected. Variables were compared with Student's t-test or Pearson chisquare test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables' influence on infection and symptoms development. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate 30 days mortality predictors, considering death as the dependent variable. We enrolled 382 subjects. The mean age was 81.15+/-10.97 years, and males were 140(36.7%). At the multivariate analysis, mental disorders, malignancies, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection while having a neurological syndrome was associated with a lower risk. Only half of the people with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological syndrome were correlated with an increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms. Fiftysix (21.2%) people with SARS-CoV-2 infection died; of these, 53 died in the first 30 days after the swab's positivity. Significant factors associated with 30-days mortality were male gender, hypokinetic disease, and the presence of fever and dyspnea. Patients' autonomy and early heparin treatment were related to lower mortality risk. Conclusions We evidenced factors associated with infection's risk and death in a setting with high mortality such as retirement nursing homes, that should be carefully considered in the management of PLRNH.Copyright Â© 2021 De Vito et al.",2021,,PLoS ONE,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248009,,#72602,A 2021,"Abigail Burn (2023-10-27 21:17:12)(Select): multivariate analysis

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare epidemiology and clinical presentation of C19-CP referring to the emergency department (ED) of our institution (San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital, Orbassano, Turin, Italy), in a 3-week observation period of the first and second COVID-19 waves, starting from the introduction of the corresponding national lockdowns. METHOD(S): We retrieved ED admissions from March 9 to 29, 2020, for the first wave, and from October 24 to November 13, 2020, for the second wave. We collected clinical characteristics of consecutive patients with molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also considered untested or SARS-CoV-2-negative cancer patients referring to the ED in the reference time frames. RESULT(S): C19-CP in the second wave exceeded those in the first wave despite the nonsignificant difference (39 of 576 v 8 of 163; P = .5). Compared with nononcological patients, C19-CP were older (median age 70 years [interquartile range 61-77] v 60 years [interquartile range 45-73]; P = .02) and presented more often with >= 2 comorbidities (40.4% v 24.3%; P = .02). Compared with nononcological patients, in C19-CP, respiratory failure (29 of 47 v 321 of 692; P = .049) and hospitalization (37 of 47 v 363 of 692; P = .0004) were higher, with comparable frequencies across the waves. Five of 24 and 10 of 27 hospitalized cancer patients in the first and second waves developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization.

This study investigated all-cause and COVID19-related deaths among middle-aged and older adults during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic period, assessing mortality risks by pre-existing socio-demographic and medical underlying conditions. METHOD(S): Population-based cohort study involving 79,083 individuals >=50years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Baseline cohort characteristics (age/sex, comorbidities and medications/vaccinations history) were established at study start (01/03/2020) and main outcomes were COVID19-related deaths (those occurred among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID19) and all-cause deaths occurred among cohort members between 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Mortality risks were assessed by Cox regression analyses. RESULT(S): Cohort members were followed for 1,356,358 persons-weeks, occurring 576 all-cause deaths (124 COVID19-related deaths). Of the 124 deceased patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID19, 112 (90.3%) died by (due to) COVID-19, while 12 (9.7%) died with COVID-19 (but likely due to other concomitant causes). All-cause mortality rate among cohort members across study period was 42.5 deaths per 100,000 persons-week, being 22.8 among healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, 236.4 in COVID19-excluded/PCR-negative subjects, 493.7 in COVID19-compatible/PCR-unperformed subjects and 4009.1 in COVID19-confirmed patients. Increasing age, sex male, nursing-home residence, cancer, neurologic, cardiac or liver disease, receiving diuretics, systemic corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality; conversely, receiving renin-angiotensin inhibitors and statins were associated with reduced risk. Age/years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.10), sex male (HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.24-2.70), nursing-home residence (HR: 12.56; 95% CI: 8.07-19.54) and number of pre-existing comorbidities (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.01-1.29) were significant predictors for COVID19-related mortality, but none specific comorbidity emerged significantly associated with an increased risk in multivariable analysis evaluating it. CONCLUSION(S): COVID19-related deaths represented more than 20 % of all-cause mortality occurred among middle-aged and older adults during the first wave of the pandemic in the region. A considerable proportion (around 10 %) of these COVID19-related deaths could be attributed to other concomitant causes. Theoretically COVID19-excluded subjects (PCR-negative) suffered ten-times greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, which points to the existence of considerable number of false negative results in earlier PCR testing and could explain part of the global excess all-cause mortality observed during the pandemic.Copyright Â© 2021.

Strategy to identify priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination: A population based cohort study(rerun),"A.G., Russo; A., Decarli; , Valsecchi M G","Background: Evidence from COVID-19 outbreak shows that individuals with specific chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe prognosis after infection. Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. Method(s): The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. Result(s): The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). Conclusion(s): This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors",2021,,Vaccine,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.076,,#72629,A 2021,James Morris (2023-10-10 22:22:58)(Select): 5518 pts with neoplasia on first line rx (grouped separate to 5 year hx of neoplasm). also gives age stratified data in cancer and not cancer cohorts.; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

However, the information about the impact of COVID-19 on the whole hematological population is scarce. We aimed to describe the 30th day overall survival (OS) after COVID-19 infection in patients with a hematological disease in Argentina. A completely anonymous survey from the Argentine Society of Hematology was delivered to all the hematologists in Argentina; it started in April 2020. A cut-off to analyze the data was performed in December 2020 and, finally, 419 patients were reported and suitable for the analysis (average age: 58 years, 90% with malignant diseases). After the COVID-19 diagnosis, the 30-day OS for the whole population was 80.2%. From the entire group (419), 101 (24.1%) individuals required intensive care unit admission, where the 30-day OS was 46.6%. Among allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, the 30-day OS was 70.3%. Factors associated with a low OS were two or more comorbidities, an active hematological disease and history of chemotherapy.

This retrospective study of 5127 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an Emergency Department in Poland between March 2020 and April 2021 aimed to identify risk factors for severe disease and mortality using the modified early warning score (MEWS). MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was based on a retrospective analysis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the Emergency Department between March 2020 and April 2021. A total of 5127 cases were included in the final analysis. Identifying the group of high-risk patients with COVID-19 was determined based on the MEWS score. RESULTS Most of the patients studied were male (53.38%). The in-hospital mortality rate among the patients was 21.53%. The factors associated with the risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 were age (>60 years, hazard ratio [HR]=2.27, P<0.001), comorbidities (cancer, HR=1.39, P=0.005; heart failure, HR=1.31, P=0.009; renal failure, HR=1.37, P=0.004), higher MEWS score (MEWS >=5, HR=1.43, P<0.001), higher percentage of lung parenchyma affected (>50%, HR=2.10, P=0.001), and higher respiratory rate (>24 breaths per min, HR=2.10, P<0.001).

Multivariate cox regression suggested age >70 years old (aHR[95%CI] 0.78[0.61-0.99]), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4-5 (aHR[95%CI] 0.61[0.46-0.80]), heart conditions (aHR[95%CI] 0.76[0.60-0.97]) would elongate viral shedding time and fully/booster vaccination (aHR[95%CI] 1.4 [1.14-1.72]) would shorten this duration. Multivariate logistic regression suggested CKD stage 4-5 (aHR[95%CI] 3.21[1.45-7.27]), cancer (aHR[95%CI] 9.52[4.19-22.61]), and long-term bedridden status (aHR[95%CI] 4.94[2.36-10.44]) were the higher risk factor compared with the elderly, heart conditions, metabolic disorders, isolated hypertension, etc. for severity while female (aHR[95%CI] 0.34[0.16-0.68]) and fully/booster Vaccination (aHR[95%CI] 0.35[0.12-0.87]) could provide protection from illness progression.

AO  - Bushman, Dena; ORCID: https:; orcid.org/0000-0001-9519-5071","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 mortality studies have primarily focused on persons aged >= 65 years; less is known about decedents aged <65 years. METHOD(S): We conducted a case-control study among NYC residents aged 21-64 years hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed March 13-April 9, 2020, to determine risk factors for death. Case-patients (n=343) were hospitalized decedents with COVID-19 and control-patients (n=686) were discharged from hospitalization with COVID-19 and matched 2:1 to case-patients on age and residential neighborhood. Conditional logistic regression models were adjusted for patient sex, insurance status, and marital status. Matched adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated for selected underlying conditions, combinations of conditions, and race/ethnic group. RESULT(S): Median age of both case-patients and control-patients was 56 years (range: 23-64 years). Having >= 1 selected underlying condition increased odds of death 4.45-fold (95% CI: 2.33-8.49). Patients with diabetes; morbid obesity; heart, kidney, or lung disease; cancer; neurologic/neurodevelopmental conditions; mental health conditions; or HIV had significantly increased odds of death. Compared with having neither condition, having both diabetes and obesity or diabetes and heart disease was associated with approximately threefold odds of death. Five select underlying conditions were more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black control-patients than among control-patients of other races/ethnicities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Selected underlying conditions were risk factors for death, and most prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities. Social services; health care resources, including vaccination; and tailored public health messaging are important for COVID-19 prevention. Strengthening these strategies for racial/ethnic minority groups could minimize COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities.Copyright Â© 2021.

Critically ill patients witnessed significantly higher mortality than severe and moderate ones. Herein, we aim to comprehensively delineate clinical features of COVID-19 and explore risk factors of developing critical disease. Method(s): This is a Mini-national multicenter, retrospective, cohort study involving 2,387 consecutive COVID-19 inpatients that underwent discharge or death between January 27 and March 21, 2020. After quality control, 2,044 COVID-19 inpatients were enrolled. Electronic medical records were collected to identify the risk factors of developing critical COVID-19. Finding(s): The severity of COVID-19 climbed up straightly with age. Critical group was characterized by higher proportion of dyspnea, systemic organ damage, and long-lasting inflammatory storm. All-cause mortality of critical group was 85*45%, by contrast with 0*58% for severe group and 0*18% for moderate group. Logistic regression revealed that sex was an effect modifier for hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), where hypertension and CHD were risk factors solely in males. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of critical illness associated with hypertension, CHD, tumor, and age >= 60 years for male, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), tumor, and age >= 60 years for female. Interpretation(s): We provide comprehensive front-line information about different severity of COVID-19 and insights into different risk factors associated with critical COVID-19 between sexes. These results highlight the significance of dividing risk factors between sexes in clinical and epidemiologic works of COVID-19, and perhaps other coronavirus appearing in future.

The demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were extracted from medical records. Patients with hospital-manifested COVID-19 (study group) and those with community-manifested COVID-19 (control group) were matched by the propensity score model. Logistic regression models were used to verify the risk factors for mortality in the study group., RESULTS: Among 7,710 hospitalized patients who had COVID-19, 7.2% developed symptoms while admitted for other reasons. Patients with hospital-manifested COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of cancer (19.2% vs 10.8%) and alcoholism (8.8% vs 2.8%) than patients with community-manifested COVID-19 and also had a higher rate of intensive care unit requirement (45.1% vs 35.2%), sepsis (23.8% vs 14.5%), and death (35.8% vs 22.5%) (P <0.05 for all). The factors independently associated with increased mortality in the study group were increasing age, male sex, number of comorbidities, and cancer., CONCLUSION: Hospital-manifested COVID-19 was associated with increased mortality.

Evaluation of the prognosis of covid-19 patients according to the presence of underlying diseases and drug treatment(rerun),"E., Kim; Y.C., Kim; J.Y., Park; J., Jung; J.P., Lee; , Kim H","Certain underlying diseases such as diabetic mellitus and hypertension are a risk factor for the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Furthermore, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are controversial at role in the process of COVID-19 cases. The aim of the study was to investigate whether underlying diseases and taking ACEi/ARBs, affect the duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Medical usage claims data for the past three years until 15 May, 2020, from the CORONA-19 International Cooperation Research project was used. We analyzed the medical insurance claims data for all 7590 coronavirus (COVID-19) patients confirmed by RTPCR tests nationwide up to May 15, 2020. Among the comorbidities, a history of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.056-2.158) and diabetes (HR, 1.867; 95% CI, 1.408-2.475) were associated significantly with mortality. Furthermore, heart failure (HR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.027-1.884), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.615; 95% CI, 1.185-2.202), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.451; 95% CI, 1.018-2.069), mental disorder (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.106-2.343), end stage renal disease (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.185-13.12) were also associated significantly with mortality. The underlying disease has increased the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and mental disorders increased mortality. Controversial whether taking ACEi/ARBs would benefit COVID-19 patients, in our study, patients taking ACEi/ARBs had a higher risk of mortality.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

We therefore analysed outcome beyond 90 days in ICU patients with COVID-19, with special focus on differences between men and women. Method(s): We identified all patient >= 18 years with COVID-19 admitted between March 6 and June 30, 2020, in the Swedish Intensive Care Registry. Patients were followed until death or study end-point October 22, 2020. Association with patient sex and mortality, in addition to clinical variables, was estimated using Cox regression. We also performed a logistic regression model estimating factors associated with 90-day mortality. Result(s): In total, 2354 patients with COVID-19 were included. Four patients were still in the ICU at study end-point. Median follow-up time was 183 days. Mortality at 90-days was 26.9%, 23.4% in women and 28.2% in men. After 90 days until end of follow-up, only 11 deaths occurred. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, male sex (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.54) remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustments. Additionally, age, COPD/asthma, immune deficiency, malignancy, SAPS3 and admission month were associated with mortality. The logistic regression model of 90-day mortality showed almost identical results. Conclusion(s): In this nationwide study of ICU patients with COVID-19, men were at higher risk of poor long-term outcome compared to their female counterparts. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are not fully understood and warrant further studies.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,Critical Care,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03511-x,,#72728,E 2021,Abe Tolley (2023-10-11 10:00:33)(Select): see additional file 3 for uni and multivariate analysis; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

AO  - Aukland, Eirik Aasen; ORCID: https:; orcid.org/0000-0003-2758-2453","OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication among critical ill patients with COVID-19, but the actual incidence is unknown as AKI-incidence varies from 25% to 89% in intensive care unit (ICU) populations. We aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors of AKI in patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU in Norway. DESIGN: Nation-wide observational study with data sampled from the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry (NIPaR) for the period between 10 March until 31 December 2020. SETTING: ICU patients with COVID-19 in Norway. NIPaR collects data on intensive care stays covering more than 90% of Norwegian ICU and 98% of ICU stays. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Norwegian ICU were included in the study. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were excluded in order to avoid bias from CKD on the incidence of AKI. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was AKI at ICU admission as defined by renal Simplified Acute Physiology Score in NIPaR. Secondary outcome measures included survival at 30 and 90 days after admission to hospital. RESULT(S): A total number of 361 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. AKI was present in 32.0% of the patients at ICU admission. The risk for AKI at ICU admission was related to acute circulatory failure at admission to hospital. Survival for the study population at 30 and 90 days was 82.5% and 77.6%, respectively. Cancer was a predictor of 30-day mortality. Age, acute circulatory failure at hospital admission and AKI at ICU admission were predictors of both 30-day and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSION(S): A high number of patients with COVID-19 had AKI at ICU admission. The study indicates that AKI at ICU admission was related to acute circulatory failure at hospital admission. Age, acute circulatory failure at hospital admission and AKI at ICU admission were associated with mortality.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Methods and results All adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in two Italian provinces were followed for a median of 24 days. ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD). The youngest deceased person aged 44 years. Among hypertensive subjects (n = 543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50-1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40-2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05-2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32-2.70) and COPD (AOR: 1.88; 1.11-3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe/lethal disease. Conclusion No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians.Copyright Â© 2020 Bravi et al.

We derived and validated a new risk model for predicting progression to disease severity, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection (Gal-COVID-19 scores). Method(s): This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Galicia, Spain. Data were extracted from electronic health records of patients, including age, sex and comorbidities according to International Classification of Primary Care codes (ICPC-2). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of disease severity. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated to assess model performance. Result(s): The incidence of infection was 0.39% (10 454 patients). A total of 2492 patients (23.8%) required hospitalization, 284 (2.7%) were admitted to the ICU and 544 (5.2%) died. The variables included in the models to predict severity included age, gender and chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, chronic kidney disease and haematological cancer. The models demonstrated a fair-good fit for predicting hospitalization {AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve] 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 0.78]}, admission to ICU [AUC 0.83 (95%CI 0.81, 0.85)] and death [AUC 0.89 (95%CI 0.88, 0.90)]. Conclusion(s): The Gal-COVID-19 scores provide risk estimates for predicting severity in COVID-19 patients. The ability to predict disease severity may help clinicians prioritize high-risk patients and facilitate the decision making of health authorities.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

"Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity in patients with haematological malignancies in Italy: a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study(rerun)","F., Passamonti; C., Cattaneo; L., Arcaini; R., Bruna; M., Cavo; F., Merli; E., Angelucci; M., Krampera; R., Cairoli; M.G., Della Porta; N., Fracchiolla; M., Ladetto; C., Gambacorti Passerini; M., Salvini; M., Marchetti; R., Lemoli; A., Molteni; A., Busca; A., Cuneo; A., Romano; N., Giuliani; S., Galimberti; A., Corso; A., Morotti; B., Falini; A., Billio; F., Gherlinzoni; G., Visani; M.C., Tisi; A., Tafuri; P., Tosi; F., Lanza; M., Massaia; M., Turrini; F., Ferrara; C., Gurrieri; D., Vallisa; M., Martelli; E., Derenzini; A., Guarini; A., Conconi; A., Cuccaro; L., Cudillo; D., Russo; F., Ciambelli; A.M., Scattolin; M., Luppi; C., Selleri; E., Ortu La Barbera; C., Ferrandina; N., Di Renzo; A., Olivieri; M., Bocchia; M., Gentile; F., Marchesi; P., Musto; A.B., Federici; A., Candoni; A., Venditti; C., Fava; A., Pinto; P., Galieni; L., Rigacci; D., Armiento; F., Pane; M., Oberti; P., Zappasodi; C., Visco; M., Franchi; P.A., Grossi; L., Bertu; G., Corrao; L., Pagano; , Corradini P","Background: Several small studies on patients with COVID-19 and haematological malignancies are available showing a high mortality in this population. The Italian Hematology Alliance on COVID-19 aimed to collect data from adult patients with haematological malignancies who required hospitalisation for COVID-19. Method(s): This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included adult patients (aged >=18 years) with diagnosis of a WHO-defined haematological malignancy admitted to 66 Italian hospitals between Feb 25 and May 18, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Data cutoff for this analysis was June 22, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality and evaluation of potential predictive parameters of mortality. We calculated standardised mortality ratios between observed death in the study cohort and expected death by applying stratum-specific mortality rates of the Italian population with COVID-19 and an Italian cohort of 31 993 patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19 (data up to March 1, 2019). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352556, and the prospective part of the study is ongoing. Finding(s): We enrolled 536 patients with a median follow-up of 20 days (IQR 10-34) at data cutoff, 85 (16%) of whom were managed as outpatients. 440 (98%) of 451 hospitalised patients completed their hospital course (were either discharged alive or died). 198 (37%) of 536 patients died. When compared with the general Italian population with COVID-19, the standardised mortality ratio was 2.04 (95% CI 1.77-2.34) in our whole study cohort and 3.72 (2.86-4.64) in individuals younger than 70 years. When compared with the non-COVID-19 cohort with haematological malignancies, the standardised mortality ratio was 41.3 (38.1-44.9). Older age (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05); progressive disease status (2.10, 1.41-3.12); diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (3.49, 1.56-7.81), indolent non-Hodgin lymphoma (2.19, 1.07-4.48), aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2.56, 1.34-4.89), or plasma cell neoplasms (2.48, 1.31-4.69), and severe or critical COVID-19 (4.08, 2.73-6.09) were associated with worse overall survival. Interpretation(s): This study adds to the evidence that patients with haematological malignancies have worse outcomes than both the general population with COVID-19 and patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19. The high mortality among patients with haematological malignancies hospitalised with COVID-19 highlights the need for aggressive infection prevention strategies, at least until effective vaccination or treatment strategies are available.

Objective(s): To evaluate the independent risk factors associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring treatment in ICUs in the Lombardy region of Italy. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This retrospective, observational cohort study included 3988 consecutive critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinating center (Fondazione IRCCS [Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico] Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network from February 20 to April 22, 2020. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. Follow-up was completed on May 30, 2020. Exposures: Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, long-term medications, and ventilatory support at ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to death in days from ICU admission to hospital discharge. The independent risk factors associated with mortality were evaluated with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Result(s): Of the 3988 patients included in this cohort study, the median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR] 56-69) years; 3188 (79.9%; 95% CI, 78.7%-81.1%) were men, and 1998 of 3300 (60.5%; 95% CI, 58.9%-62.2%) had at least 1 comorbidity. At ICU admission, 2929 patients (87.3%; 95% CI, 86.1%-88.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The median follow-up was 44 (95% CI, 40-47; IQR, 11-69; range, 0-100) days; median time from symptoms onset to ICU admission was 10 (95% CI, 9-10; IQR, 6-14) days; median length of ICU stay was 12 (95% CI, 12-13; IQR, 6-21) days; and median length of IMV was 10 (95% CI, 10-11; IQR, 6-17) days. Cumulative observation time was 164305 patient-days. Hospital and ICU mortality rates were 12 (95% CI, 11-12) and 27 (95% CI, 26-29) per 1000 patients-days, respectively. In the subgroup of the first 1715 patients, as of May 30, 2020, 865 (50.4%) had been discharged from the ICU, 836 (48.7%) had died in the ICU, and 14 (0.8%) were still in the ICU; overall, 915 patients (53.4%) died in the hospital. Independent risk factors associated with mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.60-1.92), male sex (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.31-1.88), high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.19), high positive end-expiratory pressure (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06) or low Pao2:Fio2ratio (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.87) on ICU admission, and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.28-2.19), hypercholesterolemia (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.52), and type 2 diabetes (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.39). No medication was independently associated with mortality (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.42; angiotensin receptor blockers HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85-1.29). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, most patients required IMV. The mortality rate and absolute mortality were high.Copyright Â© 2020 American Medical Association.

Predictors of Mortality for Patients with COVID-19 in the Rural Appalachian Region(rerun),"H., Bhopalwala; N., Dewaswala; S., Kolagatla; L., Wisnieski; J., Piercy; A., Bhopalwala; , Moka N","Background: The prevalence and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in rural areas is unknown. Method(s): This is a multi-center retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from April 5, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The data were extracted from 13 facilities in the Appalachian Regional Healthcare system that share the same electronic health record using ICD-10-CM codes. Result(s): The number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 per facility ranged from 5 to 535 with a median of 106 patients. Total mortality was 11.4% and ranged from 0% to 22.6% by facility (median: 9.0%). Non-survivors had a greater prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and pulmonary embolism. Patients who died were also more likely to have had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory failure (ARF), liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), dementia, cancer, anemia, and opiate dependence. Conclusion(s): The aging population, multiple co-morbidities, and health-related behaviors make rural patients vulnerable to COVID-19. A better understanding of the disease in rural areas is crucial, given its heightened vulnerability to adverse outcomes.Copyright Â© 2022 Bhopalwala et al.",2022,,International Journal of General Medicine,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S355083,,#72779,H 2022,Abigail Burn (2023-11-03 04:50:26)(Select): n(cancer) = 14; n(non-cancer) = 171; Anita Patel (2023-10-09 00:09:05)(Select): table 2 multivariable regression for cancer and in hospital deaths OR = 2.73; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments
Clinical characteristics and factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospital admission in 5 rural provinces in Indonesia: a retrospective cohort study(rerun),Surendra H.; Praptiningsih C.Y.; Ersanti A.M.; Rahmat M.; Noviyanti W.; Harmani J.A.D.; Mansur E.N.A.; Suleman Y.Y.; Sudrani S.; Rosalina R.; Mukhtar I.; Rosadi D.; Fauzi L.; Elyazar I.R.F.; Hawley W.A.; Wibisono H.,"Background Data on COVID-19 clinical characteristics and severity from resource-limited settings are limited. This study examined clinical characteristics and factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and hospitalisation in rural settings of Indonesia, from 1 January to 31 July, 2021. Methods This retrospective cohort included individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 based on polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen diagnostic test, from Lampung, Gorontalo, Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara Provinces. We extracted demographic and clinical data, including hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 surveillance records. We used mixed-effect logistic regression to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation. Results Of 6,583 confirmed cases, 205 (3.1%) died, and 1,727 (26%) were hospitalised. The median age was 37 years (IQR 26-52), with 825 (12.53%) under 20 years, and 3,371 (51.21%) females. 4,533 (68.86%) cases were symptomatic, 319 (4.85%) had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and 945 (14.36%) with at least one pre-existing comorbidity. The mortality and hospitalisation rate ranged from 2.0% and 13.4% in East Nusa Tenggara to 4.3% and 36.1% in Lampung. Age-specific mortality rates were 0.9% (2/340) for 0-4 years; 0% (0/112) for 5-9 years; 0.2% (1/498) for 10-19 years; 0.8% (11/1,385) for 20-29 years; 0.9% (12/1,382) for 30-39 years; 2% (23/1,095) for 40-49 years; 5% (57/1,064) for 50-59 years; 11% (62/576) for 60-69 years; 16% (37/232) for >=70 years. Older age, pre-existing diabetes, liver diseases, malignancy, and pneumonia were associated with higher risk of mortality and hospitalisation. Pre-existing hypertension, cardiac diseases, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and immunocompromised condition were associated with risk of hospitalisation but not with mortality. Conclusion Clinical characteristics and risk factors of severe COVID-19 outcomes in rural provinces were broadly similar to those in urban settings. The risk of COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation was associated with higher age, pre-existing chronic comorbidities, and clinical presentation of pneumonia.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Age-Related Risk Factors and Complications of Patients With COVID-19: A Population-Based Retrospective Study(rerun),"H., Zhang; Y., Wu; Y., He; X., Liu; M., Liu; Y., Tang; X., Li; G., Yang; G., Liang; S., Xu; M., Wang; , Wang W","Objective: To study the differences in clinical characteristics, risk factors, and complications across age-groups among the inpatients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): In this population-based retrospective study, we included all the positive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan City from December 29, 2019 to April 15, 2020, during the first pandemic wave. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors for death from COVID-19. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed to study the associations between comorbidities and complications. Result(s): There are 36,358 patients in the final cohort, of whom 2,492 (6.85%) died. Greater age (odds ration [OR] = 1.061 [95% CI 1.057-1.065], p < 0.001), male gender (OR = 1.726 [95% CI 1.582-1.885], p < 0.001), alcohol consumption (OR = 1.558 [95% CI 1.355-1.786], p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.326 [95% CI 1.055-1.652], p = 0.014), hypertension (OR = 1.175 [95% CI 1.067-1.293], p = 0.001), diabetes (OR = 1.258 [95% CI 1.118-1.413], p < 0.001), cancer (OR = 1.86 [95% CI 1.507-2.279], p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 1.745 [95% CI 1.427-2.12], p < 0.001), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (OR = 1.96 [95% CI 1.323-2.846], p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for death from COVID-19. Patients aged 40-80 years make up the majority of the whole patients, and them had similar risk factors with the whole patients. For patients aged <40 years, only cancer (OR = 17.112 [95% CI 6.264-39.73], p < 0.001) and ICH (OR = 31.538 [95% CI 5.213-158.787], p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher odds of death. For patients aged >80 years, only age (OR = 1.033 [95% CI 1.008-1.059], p = 0.01) and male gender (OR = 1.585 [95% CI 1.301-1.933], p < 0.001) were associated with higher odds of death. The incidence of most complications increases with age, but arrhythmias, gastrointestinal bleeding, and sepsis were more common in younger deceased patients with COVID-19, with only arrhythmia reaching statistical difference (p = 0.039). We found a relatively poor correlation between preexisting risk factors and complications. Conclusion(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 are disproportionally affected by age for its clinical manifestations, risk factors, complications, and outcomes. Prior complications have little effect on the incidence of extrapulmonary complications.Copyright Â© 2022 Zhang, Wu, He, Liu, Liu, Tang, Li, Yang, Liang, Xu, Wang and Wang.",2021,,Frontiers in Medicine,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.757459,,#72793,H 2021,"",James; cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and to develop a nomogram for predicting mortality using clinical parameters and underlying diseases. METHOD(S): This study was performed in 5,626 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between February 1 and April 30, 2020 in South Korea. A Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for predicting 30-day and 60-day survival probabilities and overall mortality, respectively in the train set. Calibration and discrimination were performed to validate the nomograms in the test set. RESULT(S): Age >= 70 years, male, presence of fever and dyspnea at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and diabetes mellitus, cancer, or dementia as underling diseases were significantly related to 30-day and 60-day survival and mortality in COVID-19 patients. The nomogram showed good calibration for survival probabilities and mortality. In the train set, the areas under the curve (AUCs) for 30-day and 60-day survival was 0.914 and 0.954, respectively; the AUC for mortality of 0.959. In the test set, AUCs for 30-day and 60-day survival was 0.876 and 0.660, respectively, and that for mortality was 0.926.

Trends and Risk Factors of In-Hospital Mortality of Patients with COVID-19 in Germany: Results of a Large Nationwide Inpatient Sample.(rerun),"Hobohm, Lukas; Sagoschen, Ingo; Barco, Stefano; Schmidtmann, Irene; Espinola-Klein, Christine; Konstantinides, Stavros; Munzel, Thomas; Keller, Karsten","Unselected data of nationwide studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are still sparse, but these data are of outstanding interest to avoid exceeding hospital capacities and overloading national healthcare systems. Thus, we sought to analyze seasonal/regional trends, predictors of in-hospital case-fatality, and mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with COVID-19 in Germany. We used the German nationwide inpatient samples to analyze all hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in Germany between 1 January and 31 December in 2020. We analyzed data of 176,137 hospitalizations of patients with confirmed COVID-19-infection. Among those, 31,607 (17.9%) died, whereby in-hospital case-fatality grew exponentially with age. Overall, age >= 70 years (OR 5.91, 95%CI 5.70-6.13, p < 0.001), pneumonia (OR 4.58, 95%CI 4.42-4.74, p < 0.001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 8.51, 95%CI 8.12-8.92, p < 0.001) were strong predictors of in-hospital death. Most COVID-19 patients were treated in hospitals in urban areas (n = 92,971) associated with the lowest case-fatality (17.5%), as compared to hospitals in suburban (18.3%) or rural areas (18.8%). MV demand was highest in November/December 2020 (32.3%, 20.3%) in patients between the 6th and 8th age decade. In the first age decade, 78 of 1861 children (4.2%) with COVID-19-infection were treated with MV, and five of them died (0.3%). The results of our study indicate seasonal and regional variations concerning the number of COVID-19 patients, necessity of MV, and case fatality in Germany.

"Patient care and clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to African high-care or intensive care units (ACCCOS): a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study.(rerun)","Investigators, African COVID-19 Critical Care Outcomes Study (ACCCOS)","BACKGROUND: There have been insufficient data for African patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill. The African COVID-19 Critical Care Outcomes Study (ACCCOS) aimed to determine which resources, comorbidities, and critical care interventions are associated with mortality in this patient population., METHODS: The ACCCOS study was a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study in adults (aged 18 years or older) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection who were referred to intensive care or high-care units in 64 hospitals in ten African countries (ie, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, and South Africa). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality censored at 30 days. We studied the factors (ie, human and facility resources, patient comorbidities, and critical care interventions) that were associated with mortality in these adult patients. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04367207., FINDINGS: From May to December, 2020, 6779 patients were referred to critical care. Of these, 3752 (55.3%) patients were admitted and 3140 (83.7%) patients from 64 hospitals in ten countries participated (mean age 55.6 years; 1890 [60.6%] of 3118 participants were male). The hospitals had a median of two intensivists (IQR 1-4) and pulse oximetry was available to all patients in 49 (86%) of 57 sites. In-hospital mortality within 30 days of admission was 48.2% (95% CI 46.4-50.0; 1483 of 3077 patients). Factors that were independently associated with mortality were increasing age per year (odds ratio 1.03; 1.02-1.04); HIV/AIDS (1.91; 1.31-2.79); diabetes (1.25; 1.01-1.56); chronic liver disease (3.48; 1.48-8.18); chronic kidney disease (1.89; 1.28-2.78); delay in admission due to a shortage of resources (2.14; 1.42-3.22); quick sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (for one factor [1.44; 1.01-2.04], for two factors [2.0; 1.33-2.99], and for three factors [3.66, 2.12-6.33]); respiratory support (high flow oxygenation [2.72; 1.46-5.08]; continuous positive airway pressure [3.93; 2.13-7.26]; invasive mechanical ventilation [15.27; 8.51-27.37]); cardiorespiratory arrest within 24 h of admission (4.43; 2.25-8.73); and vasopressor requirements (3.67; 2.77-4.86). Steroid therapy was associated with survival (0.55; 0.37-0.81). There was no difference in outcome associated with female sex (0.86; 0.69-1.06)., INTERPRETATION: Mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is higher in African countries than reported from studies done in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Increased mortality was associated with insufficient critical care resources, as well as the comorbidities of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, chronic liver disease, and kidney disease, and severity of organ dysfunction at admission., FUNDING: The ACCCOS was partially supported by a grant from the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa.

This nationwide retrospective cohort study included 5621 discharged patients with COVID-19, extracted from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) database. We compared clinical data between survivors (n=5387) and non-survivors (n=234). We used logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards model to explore risk factors of death and fatal adverse outcomes. Increased odds ratio (OR) of mortality occurred with age (>=60 years) [OR 11.685, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.655-34.150, p<0.001], isolation period, dyspnoea, altered mentality, diabetes, malignancy, dementia, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A singlecenter experience from Wuhan(rerun),"J., Wang; J., Zhang; Y., Tu; X., Zhou; H., Huang; L., Shao; L., Chen; Y., Zhao; , Ge M","Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the health-care systems all over the world. Among the booming literatures about COVID-19, there is yet a paucity of study addressing the association between COVID-19 and cancer, which is a rare comorbidity of COVID-19, as well as consensus for treatment of cancer in this pandemic. Method(s): In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, information of all inpatient cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had treatment outcome were collected from the designated departments in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China on March 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Severe events were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Result(s): A total of 716 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified. Among them, a total of 12 cases (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.7%-2.6%) had history of cancer with 4 cases (33%) experienced severe events. Compared with cases without cancer, patients with cancer have higher risks of severe events (33% vs 7.7%, p=0.012) and deaths (25% vs 3.6%, p=0.009). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that cancer was independently associated with increased odds of severe events after adjusting for other risk factors (OR 6.51, 95% CI 1.72-24.64; p=0.006). Among COVID-19 patients with cancer, we found that patients older than 60 years (75%), with other comorbidities (50%), or experiencing anticancer treatment in past month (42.9%) had a numerically higher incidence of severe events. Conclusion(s): Cancer is a rare comorbidity of patients with COVID-19; however, it cannot be overemphasized due to its poorer outcomes. We propose that personalized treatment recommendation for cancer patients should be addressed during COVID-19 pandemic, along with meticulous personal protective protocols for them to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright Â© 2020 Ivyspring International Publisher.

Factors Associated With Severe COVID-19 Infection Among Persons of Different Ages Living in a Defined Midwestern US Population(rerun),"J.L., St. Sauver; G.S., Lopes; W.A., Rocca; K., Prasad; M.R., Majerus; A.H., Limper; D.J., Jacobson; C., Fan; R.M., Jacobson; L.J., Rutten; A.D., Norman; , Vachon C M","Objective: To identify risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection in a defined Midwestern US population overall and within different age groups. Patients and Methods: We used the Rochester Epidemiology Project research infrastructure to identify persons residing in a defined 27-county Midwestern region who had positive results on polymerase chain reaction tests for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020 (N=9928). Age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, and 44 chronic disease categories were considered as possible risk factors for severe infection. Severe infection was defined as hospitalization or death caused by COVID-19. Associations between risk factors and severe infection were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models overall and within 3 age groups (0 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65+ years). Result(s): Overall, 474 (4.8%) persons developed severe COVID-19 infection. Older age, male sex, non-White race, Hispanic ethnicity, obesity, and a higher number of chronic conditions were associated with increased risk of severe infection. After adjustment, 36 chronic disease categories were significantly associated with severe infection. The risk of severe infection varied significantly across age groups. In particular, persons 0 to 44 years of age with cancer, chronic neurologic disorders, hematologic disorders, ischemic heart disease, and other endocrine disorders had a greater than 3-fold increased risk of severe infection compared with persons of the same age without those conditions. Associations were attenuated in older age groups. Conclusion(s): Older persons are more likely to experience severe infections; however, severe cases occur in younger persons as well. Our data provide insight regarding younger persons at especially high risk of severe COVID-19 infection.Copyright Â© 2021 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",2021,,Mayo Clinic Proceedings,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.06.023,,#72828,J 2021,Anushka Irodi (2023-11-04 05:22:36)(Select): Cancer as a comorbidity group (n=688 out of n=9928) with adjusted odds ratio (adjustment for age and sex clearly stated) in Table 2.; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The research was an observational descriptive study, conducted at The Family Medicine Education Center, The Primary Health Care Center, Banja Luka, in the period from 26th June to 31st December 2020. During the research period, seven family medicine teams followed their patients with COVID- 19, and recorded possible predictors for morbidity and their influence on the disease outcome. RESULT(S): The study included 934 patients, 46.90% of whom were male. The majority of subjects were non-smokers and overweight. Diabetes was found in 5.57% patients, hypertension in 29.44%, chronic respiratory diseases in 5.25%, cancer in 4.39% patients. In the observed sample, 29.23% subjects contracted pneumonia, 18.52% were hospitalized, while 19 (2.03%) patients with severe clinical features had a fatal outcome. Multivariable regression analysis showed a high risk of pneumonia in male patients [OR=2.45, 95% CI (1.73- 3.46)], elderly [OR=1.07, 95% CI (1.06-1.09)] and obese patients with Body Mass Index >=30.0 kg/m2 [OR=2.55, 95% CI (1.73- 3.77)]. Male gender [OR=2.19, 95% CI (1.11-4.31)], older age [OR=1.08, 95% CI (1.05-1.11)] and hypertension [OR=2.51, 95% CI (1.06-5.91)] were the most important predictors for the development of severe clinical features in COVID 19. The statistically significant predictors of mortality were male gender [OR=7.16, 95% CI (1.56-32.86)] and older age [OR=1.12, 95% CI (1.06-1.18].

The aim of this study is to study clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in India. Method(s): Retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in northern India. All consecutive confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases aged 15 years and older from 13 Apr till 31 Aug 2020 are included. Primary end point was 30-day mortality. Result(s): Of 1622 patients, 1536 cases were valid. Median age was 36 years, 88.3% were men and 58.1% were symptomatic. Fever (37.6%) was commonest presenting symptom. Dyspnea was reported by 15.4%. Primary hypertension (8.5%) was commonest comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus (6.7%). Mild, moderate, and severe hypoxemia were seen in 3.4%, 4.3%, and 0.8% respectively. Logistic regression showed greater odds of moderate/severe disease in patients with dyspnea, hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and malignancy. Seventy six patients died (4.9%). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards model for mortality, patients with dyspnea (hazard ratio [HR]: 14.449 [5.043-41.402]), altered sensorium (HR: 2.762 [1.142-6.683]), Diabetes Mellitus (HR: 1.734 [1.001-3.009]), malignancy (HR:10.443 [4.396-24.805]) and Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) (HR: 14.432 [2.321-89.715]) had higher risk. Rising respiratory rate (HR: 1.098 [1.048-1.150]), falling oxygen saturation (HR: 1.057 per unit change 95% CI: 1.028-1.085) were significant predictors. Conclusion(s): Analysis suggests that age, dyspnea, and malignancy were associated with both severe disease and mortality. Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Liver Disease were associated with increased the risk of fatal outcome. Simple clinical parameters such as respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are strong predictors and with other risk factors at admission can be effectively used to triage patients.Copyright Â© 2021",2021,,Medical Journal Armed Forces India,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.01.009,,#72847,K 2021,Mark Cheng (2023-11-04 11:24:58)(Select): adjusted OR given on table 4 (severe disease) and 6 (mortality) - uses cox-proportional hazards regression; Shazia  Sarela (2023-11-04 00:16:51)(Select): 45 cancer as comorbidity patients out of 1536 ; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

All COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Jordan from September 20, 2020, to August 8, 2021, were included in this study. Demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory results were extracted from the patients' electronic records. Multivariable logistic and machine learning (ML) methods were used to study variable importance. Out of 1,613 COVID-19 patients, 1,004 (62.2%) were discharged from the hospital (survived), while 609 (37.8%) died. Patients who were of elderly age (>65 years) (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.28-3.16), current smokers (OR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.17-2.23), and had severe or critical illness at admission ((OR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.05-2.32) (OR, 2.94; 95%CI, 2.02-4.27); respectively), were at higher risk of mortality. Comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.90-4.43), deep venous thrombosis (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.08-6.35), malignancy (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.46-3.38), diabetes (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04-1.65), and heart failure (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.23) were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. Laboratory abnormalities associated with mortality included hypernatremia (OR, 11.37; 95% CI, 4.33-29.81), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.42-2.31), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.25), and low platelets level (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95). Several demographic, clinical, and laboratory risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were identified.

Effect of Comorbidities on the Infection Rate and Severity of COVID-19: Nationwide Cohort Study With Propensity Score Matching.(rerun),"Kim, Jiyong; Park, Seong Hun; Kim, Jong Moon","BACKGROUND: A vaccine against COVID-19 has been developed; however, COVID-19 transmission continues. Although there have been many studies of comorbidities that have important roles in COVID-19, some studies have reported contradictory results., OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted using real-world data from COVID-19 patients in South Korea and aimed to investigate the impact of patient demographics and comorbidities on the infection rate and severity of COVID-19., METHODS: Data were derived from a nationwide South Korean COVID-19 cohort study with propensity score (PS) matching. We included infected individuals who were COVID-19-positive between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and PS-matched uninfected controls. PS matching was performed to balance the baseline characteristics of each comorbidity and to adjust for potential confounders, such as age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, medication, and other comorbidities, that were matched with binary variables. The outcomes were the confirmed comorbidities affecting the infection rate and severity of COVID-19. The endpoints were COVID-19 positivity and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (such as tracheostomy, continuous renal replacement therapy, intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death)., RESULTS: The COVID-19 cohort with PS matching included 8070 individuals with positive COVID-19 test results and 8070 matched controls. The proportions of patients in the severe group were higher for individuals 60 years or older (severe clinical outcomes for those 60 years or older, 16.52%; severe clinical outcomes for those of other ages, 2.12%), those insured with Medicaid (Medicaid, 10.81%; other insurance, 5.61%), and those with disabilities (with disabilities, 18.26%; without disabilities, 5.07%). The COVID-19 infection rate was high for patients with pulmonary disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.88; 95% CI 1.70-2.03), dementia (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.40-2.20), gastrointestinal disease (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.62-1.88), stroke (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.23-2.27), hepatobiliary disease (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.19-1.44), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.16-1.43), and cardiovascular disease (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07-1.35). In contrast, it was lower for individuals with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.67-0.80), autoimmune disease (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.89), and cancer (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.86). The severity of COVID-19 was high for individuals with kidney disease (OR 5.59; 95% CI 2.48-12.63), hypertension (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.91-4.47), dementia (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.91-4.47), cancer (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.15-2.94), pulmonary disease (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.35-2.19), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.17-2.04), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.87), and psychotic disorders (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01-6.52). However, it was low for those with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.60-1.00)., CONCLUSIONS: Upon PS matching considering the use of statins, it was concluded that people with hyperlipidemia could have lower infection rates and disease severity of COVID-19.

However, limited data are available regarding in-hospital mortality during the Omicron phase of the pandemic. Therefore, the aim of the study was the comparison of mortality in patients with history of cancer and patients with active cancer disease during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the current Omicron variant of concern., METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational, epidemiological cohort study at 45 hospitals in Germany. Until July 20, 2022, all adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality regarding cancer status (history of cancer and active cancer disease) and SARS-CoV-2 virus type., RESULTS: From March 11, 2020, to July 20, 2022, a total of 27,490 adult SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included in the study. 2,578 patients (9.4%) had diagnosis of cancer, of whom 1,065 (41.3%) had history of cancer, whereas 1,513 (58.7%) had active cancer disease. Overall 3,749 out of the total of 27,490 patients (13.6%) died during the hospital stay. Patients with active cancer disease had a significantly higher mortality compared to patients without cancer diagnosis, in both phases of the pandemic (wild-type to Delta: OR 1.940 [1.646-2.285]); Omicron: 2.864 [2.354-3.486]). After adjustment to co-variables, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with active cancer disease had the highest risk for in-hospital mortality compared to the other groups, in both phases of the pandemic., CONCLUSION: The CORONA Germany study indicates that hospitalized patients with active cancer disease are at high risk of death during a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mortality of patients with history of cancer improved to nearly the level of non-cancer patients during Omicron phase. Copyright Â© 2023 S.

Cases were recruited sequentially from March 2020 until December-March 2021. All information regarding cases and controls was extracted retrospectively from the medical records of patients by trained physicians. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to assess the association between various predictor variables and deaths due to COVID-19. A total of 2,431 patients (1,137 cases and 1,294 controls) were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 52.8 years (SD: 16.5 years), and 32.1% were females. Breathlessness was the most common symptom at the time of admission (53.2%). Increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 46-59 years, 3.4 [95% CI: 1.5-7.7]; 60-74 years, 4.1 [95% CI: 1.7-9.5]; and >= 75 years, 11.0 [95% CI: 4.0-30.6]); preexisting diabetes mellitus (aOR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.2-2.9]); malignancy (aOR: 3.1 [95% CI: 1.3-7.8]); pulmonary tuberculosis (aOR: 3.3 [95% CI: 1.2-8.8]); breathlessness at the time of admission (aOR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.4-3.5]); high quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at the time of admission (aOR: 5.6 [95% CI: 2.7-11.4]); and oxygen saturation < 94% at the time of admission (aOR: 2.5 [95% CI: 1.6-3.9]) were associated with mortality due to COVID-19.

Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, health care exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled in a population-based study before the pandemic (n=67 cancer patients; n=256 noncancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.12 to 4.18) and 30-day mortality (odds ratio = 5.67, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

The impact of social distancing on blood stocks was significant. Data on the use of blood products by patients with COVID-19 are scarce. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective observational study was conducted by analysing the medical records of 3014 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in 16 Brazilian hospitals. Individual data related to clinical, laboratory and transfusion characteristics and outcomes of these patients were collected. Patients characteristics association with mortality and transfusion need were tested independently by logistic regression models. Result(s): Patients mean age was 57.6 years. In 2298 (76.2%) patients, there was an underlying clinical comorbidity. A total of 1657 (55%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and 943 (31%) patients required ventilatory support and orotracheal intubation (OTI). There was a total of 471 (15.6%) deaths among all patients. 325 patients (10.7%) required blood transfusion; 3187 blood products were transfused: 1364 red blood cells in 303 patients, 1092 platelet units in 78 patients, 303 fresh frozen plasma in 49 patients and 423 cryoprecipitates in 21 patients. The mortality among patients who received transfusion was substantially higher than that among the total study population. Conclusion(s): Need for transfusion was low in COVID-19 patients, but significantly higher in patients admitted to ICU and in those who needed OTI. Knowledge of the transfusion profile of these patients allows better strategies for maintaining the blood stocks of hospitals during the pandemic.Copyright Â© 2021 International Society of Blood Transfusion",2021,,Vox Sanguinis,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vox.13087,,#72873,L 2021,Abigail Burn (2023-11-12 05:26:04)(Included): unclear how mortality defined; Mark Cheng (2023-11-04 12:24:59)(Select): useful - one of tables being table 5; Anushka Irodi (2023-11-04 10:46:46)(Select): Cancer as a comorbidity group (n=153 out of n=3014); adjusted odds ratio in multiple regression model (not adjusted for sex as this was judged to minimally affect results); ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

All these patients had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular methods. During the study period 504/1697 patients died; thus, overall CFR was 29.7%. We looked for predictors of mortality in a subgroup of 486 patients (239 males, 59%; median age 71 years) for whom sufficient clinical data were available at data cut-off. Among the demographic and clinical variables considered, age, a diagnosis of cancer, obesity and current smoking independently predicted mortality. When laboratory data were added to the model in a further subgroup of patients, age, the diagnosis of cancer, and the baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio were identified as independent predictors of mortality. In conclusion, the CFR of hospitalized patients in Northern Italy during the ascending phase of the COVID-19 pandemic approached 30%.

This study aimed to compare the imaging and staging findings of the COVID-19 pneumonia CT scan in patients with and without cancer. Method(s): In this case-control study, 109 cancer patients as the case group and 214 non-cancer patients as the control group were included. Covid-19 patients with and without cancer referred to Amir Al-Momenin, and Khansari Hospital in Arak city from June 2020 to July 2021 were included. The data were organized into demographics, underlying medical conditions, ICU admission, and imaging findings. Result(s): Overall, 323 Covid-19 patients were included in the analysis, and 109 cases of them were cancer patients. The mean age was 63.12+/-15.38 years, and 53.87% were female. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate (41.28% vs 41.28%12.62%) was significantly higher in the cancer group than in the control group (P<0.001). The involvement of lung lobes in the cancer group was higher than in the control group (P=0.011) (70.56% in the left lung and 71.1% in the right lung of cancer patients than 77.40% in the left lung and 83.10% in the right lung). The presence of Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) was higher in CT images of the cancer group in all lobs. This difference in the right upper lobe (RUL) lob was significant (P=0.011) and consolidation (CON) was higher in CT images of the control group, but the differences were not significant (P>0.05). The mean total score in the cancer group was 6.23+/-2.76 and in the control group was 5.87+/-2.23 (P=0.202). The mean score in the cancer group of left lower lobe (LLL) lung lobes was 1.46+/-0.94 and in the control group was 1.21+/-0.76 (P=0.010) (Table 2). Conclusion(s): The results showed that GGO and consolidation were common findings in CT images. GGO was higher in cancer patients.

This study aimed to identify three risk categories based on inflammatory parameters on admission. (2) Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, collected and followed-up from 1 March to 31 July 2020, from the nationwide Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. The three categories of low, intermediate, and high risk were determined by taking into consideration the terciles of the total lymphocyte count and the values of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and D-dimer taken at the time of admission. (3) Results: A total of 17,122 patients were included in the study. The high-risk group was older (57.9 vs. 64.2 vs. 70.4 years; p < 0.001) and predominantly male (37.5% vs. 46.9% vs. 60.1%; p < 0.001). They had a higher degree of dependence in daily tasks prior to admission (moderate-severe dependency in 10.8% vs. 14.1% vs. 17%; p < 0.001), arterial hypertension (36.9% vs. 45.2% vs. 52.8%; p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (28.4% vs. 37% vs. 40.6%; p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (11.9% vs. 17.1% vs. 20.5%; p < 0.001), ischemic heart disease (3.7% vs. 6.5% vs. 8.4%; p < 0.001), heart failure (3.4% vs. 5.2% vs. 7.6%; p < 0.001), liver disease (1.1% vs. 3% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.002), chronic renal failure (2.3% vs. 3.6% vs. 6.7%; p < 0.001), cancer (6.5% vs. 7.2% vs. 11.1%; p < 0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.7% vs. 5.4% vs. 7.1%; p < 0.001). They presented more frequently with fever, dyspnea, and vomiting. These patients more frequently required high flow nasal cannula (3.1% vs. 4.4% vs. 9.7%; p < 0.001), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (0.9% vs. 3% vs. 6.3%; p < 0.001), invasive mechanical ventilation (0.6% vs. 2.7% vs. 8.7%; p < 0.001), and ICU admission (0.9% vs. 3.6% vs. 10.6%; p < 0.001), and had a higher percentage of in-hospital mortality (2.3% vs. 6.2% vs. 23.9%; p < 0.001). The three risk categories proved to be an independent risk factor in multivariate analyses.

Patients with a history of chronic conditions, obesity, and cancer are at greater risk from COVID-19; moreover, concerns surrounding the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs) and its relationship to COVID-19 susceptibility have increased since the beginning of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): The objectives of this study were to compare the characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those of patients without COVID-19 in primary care; to determine the risk factors associated with the outcome of mortality; and to determine the potential influence of certain medications, such as ACEIs and ARBs, on the mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): An observational retrospective study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Catalan Central Region of Spain between March 1 and August 17, 2020, was conducted. The data were obtained from the Primary Care Services Information Technologies System of the Catalan Institute of Health in Barcelona, Spain. RESULT(S): The study population included 348,596 patients (aged >15 years) registered in the Primary Care Services Information Technologies System of the Catalan Central Region. The mean age of the patients was 49.53 years (SD 19.42), and 31.17% of the patients were aged >=60 years. 175,484/348,596 patients (50.34%) were women. A total of 23,844/348,596 patients (6.84%) in the population studied were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period, and the most common clinical conditions of these patients were hypertension (5267 patients, 22.1%) and obesity (5181 patients, 21.7%). Overall, 2680/348,596 patients in the study population (0.77%) died during the study period. The number of deaths among patients without COVID-19 was 1825/324,752 (0.56%; mean age 80.6 years, SD 13.3), while among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the number of deaths was 855/23,844 (3.58%; mean age 83.0 years, SD 10.80) with an OR of 6.58 (95% CI 6.06-7.15). CONCLUSION(S): We observed that women were more likely to contract COVID-19 than men. In addition, our study did not show that hypertension, obesity, or being treated with ACEIs or ARBs was linked to an increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19.

We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with history of HM and acute COVID-19 to evaluate thrombotic and clinical outcomes. Method(s): Patients with COVID-19 were identified by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Our primary endpoints were rate of VTE and CVA in patients with HM compared to the general population (GP). Secondary outcomes included composite thrombotic events (CVA + VTE), COVID-19 fatality, respiratory support, ICU admission rates, and length of ICU stay Results: A total of 833 patients were evaluated, 709 in the GP cohort, 124 patients in the HM cohort. CVA was more prevalent in the HM cohort (5.4% vs. 1.6%, P = .011). Rates of VTE were numerically higher for the HM cohort (8.0% vs. 3.6%, P = .069). The composite thrombotic rate was increased in the HM cohort (13.4% vs. 5.2%, P = .005). Patients with HM had a higher inpatient fatality rate (35.5% vs. 11.3%, P < .001), required more respiratory support (74.6% vs. 46.5%, P < .001) and had a higher rate of ICU admission (31.9% vs. 12.1%, P = .001). Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrated an increased rate of composite thrombotic (CVA + VTE) outcomes, indicating HM patients with acute COVID-19 are at increased risk of thrombosis. Irrespective of disease status, HM patients also have significantly increased need for intensive care, respiratory support, and have higher fatality rates.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,"Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma and Leukemia",,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2021.12.011,,#72919,M 2022,"",James; cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); true cancer vs non-cancer; univariate only

Factors associated with ICU hospitalization were age < 75 years, oxygen supply, chronic pulmonary disease, absence of dementia, and high levels of CRP, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine. Among the 600 patients, 80 (13.3%) had an acute renal injury, 33 (5.5%) had a cardiovascular event, 27 (4.5%) had an acute liver injury, 24 (4%) had venous thromboembolism, eight (1.3%) had a neurological event, five (0.8%) had rhabdomyolysis, and one had acute pancreatitis. Most extrapulmonary complications occurred in ICU patients. Conclusion(s): This study highlighted the main risk factors for ICU hospitalization and death caused by severe COVID-19 and the frequency of numerous extrapulmonary complications in France.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",2021,,Infectious diseases now,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.07.002,,#72932,Martinot 2021,James Morris (2023-10-12 00:21:05)(Select): cancer no.s in table 1.

Predictors of hospital length of stay and mortality among COVID-19 inpatients during 2020-2021 in Hormozgan Province of Iran: A retrospective cohort study.(rerun),"Mastaneh, Zahra; Mouseli, Ali; Mohseni, Shokrollah; Dadipoor, Sara","Background and Aims: About one-fifth of patients with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized. Predicting factors affecting the hospital length of stay (LOS) can be effective in prioritizing patients, planning for services, and preventing the increase in LOS and death of patients. The present study aimed to identify the factors that predict LOS and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a retrospective cohort study., Methods: A total of 27,859 patients were admitted to 22 hospitals from February 20, 2020 to June 21, 2021. The data collected from 12,454 patients were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data were captured from the MCMC (Medical Care Monitoring Center) database. The study tracked patients until their hospital discharge or death. Hospital LOS and mortality were assessed as the study outcomes., Results: As the results revealed, 50.8% of patients were male and 49.2% were female. The mean hospital LOS of the discharged patients was 4.94. Yet, 9.1% of the patients (n = 1133) died. Among the predictors of mortality and long hospital LOS were the age above 60, admission to the ICU, coughs, respiratory distress, intubation, oxygen level less than 93%, cigarette and drug abuse, and a history of chronic diseases. Masculinity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cancer were the effective variables in mortality, and positive CT was a factor significantly affecting the hospital LOS., Conclusion: Paying special attention to high-risk patients and modifiable risk factors such as heart disease, liver disease, and other chronic diseases can diminish the complications and mortality rate of COVID-19. Providing training, especially for those who care for patients experiencing respiratory distress such as nurses and operating room personnel can improve the qualifications and skills of medical staff. Also, ensuring the availability of sufficient supply of medical equipment is strongly recommended. Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

Changes in the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients from the early pandemic to the delta variant epidemic: a nationwide population-based study.(rerun),"Miyashita, Koichi; Hozumi, Hironao; Furuhashi, Kazuki; Nakatani, Eiji; Inoue, Yusuke; Yasui, Hideki; Karayama, Masato; Suzuki, Yuzo; Fujisawa, Tomoyuki; Enomoto, Noriyuki; Inui, Naoki; Ojima, Toshiyuki; Suda, Takafumi","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed because of virus mutations, vaccine dissemination, treatment development and policies, among other factors. These factors have a dynamic and complex effect on the characteristics and outcomes of patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand those changes and update the evidence. We used a large-scale real-world data set of 937,758 patients with COVID-19 from a nationwide claims database that included outpatients and inpatients in Japan to investigate the changes in their characteristics, outcomes and risk factors for severity/mortality from the early pandemic to the delta variant-predominant waves. The severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the modified World Health Organization clinical-progression ordinal scale. With changing waves, mean patient age decreased, and proportion of patients with comorbidities decreased. The incidences of severe COVID-19 or death (i.e. >=severe COVID-19) and death markedly declined (5.0% and 2.9%, wild-type-predominant; 4.6% and 2.2%, alpha variant-predominant and 1.4% and 0.4%, delta variant-predominant waves, respectively). Across the wave shift, risk factors for >= severe COVID-19 and death, including older age, male, malignancy, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were largely consistent. The significance of some factors, such as liver disease, varied as per the wave. This study, one of the largest population-based studies on COVID-19, showed that patient characteristics and outcomes changed during the waves. Risk factors for severity/mortality were similar across all waves, but some factors were inconsistent. These data suggest that the clinical status of COVID-19 will change further with the coming epidemic wave.",2023,,Emerging microbes & infections,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2022.2155250,,#72937,Miyashita 2023,"Fazal Shah (2023-10-05 21:57:09)(Select): See Supplementary Tables 3, 5 and 6 - stratifies OR for mortality and severity by COVID variant; ",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

We compared patients with COVID-19 admitted to Danish ICUs in the first wave with those admitted later. METHOD(S): Among all Danish ICU patients with COVID-19, we compared demographics, chronic comorbidities, use of organ support, length of stay and vital status of those admitted 10th March to 19th May 2020 (first wave) versus 20th May 2020 to 30th June 2021. We analysed risk factors for death by adjusted logistic regression analysis. RESULT(S): Among all hospitalised patients with COVID-19, a lower proportion was admitted to ICU after the first wave (13 vs 8%). Among all 1374 ICU patients with COVID-19, 326 were admitted during the first wave. There were no major differences in patient's characteristics or mortality between the two periods, but use of invasive mechanical ventilation (81% vs 58% of patients), renal replacement therapy (26% vs. 13%) and ECMO (8% vs 3%) and median length of stay in ICU (13 vs 10days) and in hospital (20 vs 17days) were all significantly lower after the first wave. Risk factors for death were higher age, larger burden of co-morbidity (hearth failure, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease), and active cancer, but not admission during or after the first wave. CONCLUSION(S): After the first wave of COVID-19 in Denmark, a lower proportion of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 was admitted to ICU. Among ICU patients, use of organ support was lower and length of stay was reduced, but mortality rates remained at a relatively high level. EDITORIAL COMMENT: This study assessed the temporal changes in the care of patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU care in Denmark. The findings showed that while a lower ratio of patients with documented infections required ICU and they required less organ support, ICU mortality remained unchanged. This might reflect the effects of vaccines on disease severity and improvement in floor management of hypoxic patients, but also underscores that COVID-19 remains a serious threat to the health of many patients, in particularly elderly patients with a high degree of comorbidity.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Identification of patients at increased risk of death following hospital discharge is needed to guide clinical monitoring and early intervention. Herein, we aimed to identify predictors of early vs. late mortality in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): A total of 471 patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were followed up for 9 months [median (inter-quartile range) of follow-up time: 271 (14) days] after hospital admission. COVID-19-related signs and symptoms, laboratory features, co-morbidities, Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (4C) mortality and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) scores were analysed by logistic regression for association with early (28 day) vs. late mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the discriminative value of 4C and CFS scores for early vs. late mortality. Result(s): A total of 120 patients died within 28 days from hospital admission. Of the remaining 351 patients, 41 died within the next 8 months. Respiratory failure, systemic inflammation, and renal impairment were associated with early mortality, while active cancer and dementia were associated with late mortality, after adjustment for age and sex. 4C mortality score and CFS were associated with both early [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval-CI): 4C: 1.34 (1.25-1.45); CFS: 1.49 (1.33-1.66)] and late [OR (95% CI): 4C: 1.23 (1.12-1.36); CFS: 2.04 (1.62-2.56)] mortality. After adjustment for CFS, the association between 4C and late mortality was lost. By ROC analysis, 4C mortality score was superior to CFS for 28 day mortality [area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI): 0.779 (0.732-0.825) vs. 0.723 (0.673-0.773), respectively; P = 0.039]. In contrast, CFS had higher predictive value for late mortality compared with 4C mortality score [AUC (95% CI): 0.830 (0.776-0.883) vs. 0.724 (0.650-0.798), respectively; P = 0.007]. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, late mortality in COVID-19 patients is more strongly associated with premorbid clinical frailty than with severity of the acute infection phase.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the records of 4014 consecutive adults hospitalized for COVID-19 in a tertiary-level institution from March 2020 to March 2021. Results The median age was 74 years. A total of 2256 (56.2%) patients were men. The median Charlson-comorbidity-index (CCI) was 4 points; 3359 (82.7%) patients had severe or critical COVID-19. A significant interaction between age, sex, and survival (P< 0.05) persisted after adjustment for CCI. In patients <57 years, male sex was related to a favorable (odds ration [OR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.86), whereas in patients >=57 years it was related to an unfavorable prognosis (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.37). Comorbidities associated with inferior survival independently of age, sex, and severe/critical COVID-19 on admission were chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, acute cerebrovascular insult, history of venous thromboembolism, chronic kidney disease, major bleeding, liver cirrhosis, mental retardation, dementia, active malignant disease, metastatic malignant disease, autoimmune/rheumatic disease, bilateral pneumonia, and other infections on admission. Conclusion Among younger patients, female sex might lead to an adverse prognosis due to undisclosed reasons (differences in fat tissue distribution, hormonal status, and other mechanisms). Patient subgroups with specific comorbidities require additional considerations during hospital stay for COVID-19.

We describe the clinical course and examine factors associated with outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Germany., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we included patients with COVID-19 admitted to a national network of German hospitals between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We examined demographic characteristics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes., RESULTS: We included 1904 patients with a median age of 73 years, 48.5% (924/1904) of whom were female. The mortality rate was 17% (317/1835; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 16-19), the rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 21% (399/1860; 95%CI 20-23), and the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation was 14% (250/1850: 95%CI 12-15).

The outcomes evaluated were 60-day mortality, time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance, need for hospitalization, and O2 therapy., RESULTS: Among 1026 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 60.2% received casirivamab/imdevimab and 39.8% sotrivimab. Median age was 63 years, 52.4% were males and median time from positive nasopharyngeal swab to mAbs administration was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-5). 78.1% were vaccinated. Overall, the 60-day mortality was 2.14%. No differences in outcomes were observed between the two mAbs used. No difference was observed in mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients (P = 0.925); although, lower rate of hospitalization (P <0.005), less need for O2 therapy (P <0.0001) and reduced nasopharyngeal swab negativity time (P <0.0001) were observed in vaccinated patients. Early administration of mAbs was associated with lower mortality (P <0.007), whereas corticosteroid use worsened prognosis (P <0.004). The independent predictors associated with higher mortality were older age (P <0.0001), presence of active hematologic malignancies (P <0.0001), renal failure (P <0.041), and need for O2 therapy (P <0.001)., CONCLUSION: This study shows similar effectiveness among mAbs used, regardless of vaccination status and identifies patients with COVID-19 in whom mAbs have poor activity.

We assessed the association of symptom status and medical comorbidities on mortality and hospitalization risk associated with COVID-19 in residents across 15 nursing homes in Maryland. Design(s): Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants: 1970 residents from 15 nursing home facilities with universal COVID-19 testing in Maryland. Method(s): We used descriptive statistics to compare baseline characteristics, logistic regression to assess the association of comorbidities with COVID-19, and Cox regression to assess the association of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with mortality and hospitalization. We assessed the association of comorbidities with mortality and hospitalization risk. Symptom status was assessed at the time of the first test. Maximum follow-up was 94 days. Result(s): Among the 1970 residents (mean age 73.8, 57% female, 68% black), 752 (38.2%) were positive on their first test. Residents who were positive for COVID-19 and had multiple symptoms at the time of testing had the highest risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.97, 6.65) and hospitalization (subhazard ratio 2.38, 95% CI 1.70, 3.33), even after accounting for comorbidity burden. Cases who were asymptomatic at testing had a higher risk of mortality (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.95, 4.35) but not hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82, 1.38) compared with those who were negative for COVID-19. Of 52 SARS-CoV-2-positive residents who were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were closely monitored for 14 days at one facility, only 6 (11.6%) developed symptoms. Conclusions and Implications: Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the nursing home setting was associated with increased risk of death, suggesting a need for closer monitoring of these residents, particularly those with underlying cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities.Copyright Â© 2020 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine",2020,,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.011,,#72963,O 2020,"Anita Patel (2023-11-06 06:20:01)(Select): cancer as comorbidity (cancer = 61 vs. 691).

This is a retrospective cohort study of people with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to May 22, 2020. Data retrieved for this study included patient sociodemographic data, baseline comorbidities, baseline treatments, other background data on care provided in hospital or primary care settings, and vital status. Main outcome was deaths until June 29, 2020. In the multivariable model based on nursing home residents, predictors of mortality were being male, older than 80 years, admitted to a hospital for COVID-19, and having cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or dementia while taking anticoagulants or lipid-lowering drugs at baseline was protective. The AUC was 0.754 for the risk score based on this model and 0.717 in the validation subsample. Predictors of death among people from the general population were being male and/or older than 60 years, having been hospitalized in the month before admission for COVID-19, being admitted to a hospital for COVID-19, having cardiovascular disease, dementia, respiratory disease, liver disease, diabetes with organ damage, or cancer while being on anticoagulants was protective. The AUC was 0.941 for this model's risk score and 0.938 in the validation subsample. Our risk scores could help physicians identify high-risk groups and establish preventive measures and better follow-up for patients at high risk of dying.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04463706.Copyright Â© 2021.

Material(s) and Method(s): This is a retrospective study of patients 65 years old or older with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Hospital, between March 11 and May 28, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors for in-hospital death. Result(s): A total of 218 patients (112 men, 106 women) were included, of whom 166 were discharged and 52 died in hospital. With univariate analysis, various clinical features and laboratory variables were found to be significantly different (i.e. P < 0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis the following were independently associated with mortality: present malignancy [odds ratio (OR) = 4.817, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.107-20.958, P: 0.036]; dyspnea (OR = 4.652, 95% CI = 1.473-14.688, P: 0.009); neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR; OR = 1.097, 95% CI = 1.012-1.188, P: 0.025); the highest values of C-reactive protein (CRP; OR = 1.006, 95% CI = 1.000-1.012, P: 0.049), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.001-1.004, P: 0.003), and creatinine levels (OR = 1.497, 95% CI = 1.126-1.990, P: 0.006); oxygen saturation (SpO2) values on admission (OR = 0.897, 95% CI = 0.811-0.993, P: 0.036); and azithromycin use (OR = 0.239, 95% CI = 0.065-0.874, P: 0.031). Conclusion(s): The presence of malignancy; symptoms of dyspnea; high NLR; highest CRP, LDH, and creatinine levels; and low SpO2 on admission predicted mortality. On the other hand, azithromycin use was found to be protective against mortality.

Association of Race and Ethnicity with Comorbidities and Survival among Patients with COVID-19 at an Urban Medical Center in New York(rerun),"R., Kabarriti; N.P., Brodin; M.I., Maron; C., Guha; S., Kalnicki; M.K., Garg; , Racine A D","Importance: As of May 11, 2020, there have been more than 290000 deaths worldwide from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Risk-adjusted differences in outcomes among patients of differing ethnicity and race categories are not well characterized. Objective(s): To investigate whether presenting comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 in New York City differed by race/ethnicity and whether case fatality rates varied among different ethnic and racial groups, controlling for presenting comorbidities and other risk factors. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included 5902 patients who presented for care to the Montefiore Medical Center, a large urban academic medical center in the Bronx, New York, between March 14 and April 15, 2020, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Final data collection was April 27, 2020. Exposures: Patient characteristics, including self-identified ethnicity/race, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and medical comorbidities, were tabulated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival. Associations between patient demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity were examined using chi2tests, and the association with survival was assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, based on time from positive COVID-19 test. Result(s): Of 9268 patients who were tested, 5902 ethnically diverse patients (63.7%) had SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 3129 patients (53.0%) were women, and the median (interquartile range) age was 58 (44-71) years. A total of 918 patients (15.5%) died within the study time frame. Overall, 1905 patients (32.3%) identified as Hispanic; 1935 (32.8%), non-Hispanic Black; 509 (8.6%), non-Hispanic White; and 171 (2.9%), Asian; the death rates were 16.2% (309), 17.2% (333), 20.0% (102), and 17.0% (29), respectively (P =.25). Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black patients had a higher proportion of more than 2 medical comorbidities with 654 (34.3%) and 764 (39.5%), respectively, compared with 147 (28.9%) among non-Hispanic White patients (P <.001). Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black patients were also more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than White patients, with 1905 of 2919 Hispanic patients (65.3%), 1935 of 2823 non-Hispanic Black patients (68.5%), and 509 of 960 non-Hispanic White patients (53.0%) having positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 (P <.001). While controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status and comorbidities, patients identifying as Hispanic (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98; P =.03) or non-Hispanic Black (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.87; P =.002) had slightly improved survival compared with non-Hispanic White patients. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19 who presented for care at the same urban medical center, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients did not experience worse risk-adjusted outcomes compared with their White counterparts.

As many comorbidities are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we sought to investigate the effects of comorbidities in these patients on infection severity. Aim(s): To evaluate association between individual comorbidities and COVID-19 infection severity among patients with IBD. Method(s): Data were obtained from SECURE-IBD, an international registry created to evaluate COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD. We used multivariable regression to analyze associations between eleven non-IBD comorbidities and a composite primary outcome of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Comorbidities were first modeled individually, adjusting for potential confounders. Next, to determine the independent effect of comorbidities, we fit a model including all comorbidities as covariates. Result(s): We analyzed 2,035 patients from 58 countries (mean age 42.7 years, 50.6% male). A total of 538 patients (26.4%) experienced severe COVID-19. All comorbidities but a history of stroke and obesity were associated with severe infection in our initial analysis, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.9 to 3.7. In a model including all comorbidities significantly associated with the composite outcome in the initial analysis, as well as other confounders, most comorbidities remained significant, with the highest risk in chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusion(s): Many non-IBD comorbidities are associated with a two to threefold increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death among patients with IBD. These data can be used to risk-stratify and guide treatment and lifestyle decisions during the ongoing pandemic.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",2022,,Digestive Diseases and Sciences,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10620-021-07104-0,,#73000,R 2022,"Abe Tolley (2023-11-02 09:11:14)(Select): Given laboratory testing confirmed, I think can include, data will be all IBD patients  - so not sure how that will be adjusted for on MA, maybe just in subgroup?

Data comparing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients in Saudi Arabia during the first and second waves are lacking. This study compares the characteristics and the outcomes of patients in these 2 waves. Method(s): This is a retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. We compared epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, and clinical data. Result(s): The study included hospitalized patients admitted up to February 28, 2021 as the first wave and those admitted from March 1, 2021 as the second wave. There were 378 patients in the first wave and 241 patients in the second wave. Patients in the first wave were significantly younger (mean age and SD of 47.5 +/- 20 vs 55.3 +/- 18.2 years; p <0.001). In relation to symptoms, shortness of breath, wheezes, myalgia, tachypnea, and respiratory distress were significantly more common in the second wave than the first wave. On the other hand, sore throat was more common in the first wave than the second wave. Patients in the second wave had higher mean values of lymphocytes count, platelet counts, and ALT than those in the first wave. Patients in the first wave were more likely to receive antibiotics and antiviral therapy and had higher death rate (16.2% vs 8.4%; p = 0.001).

Patients' treatment limitations as predictive factor for mortality in COVID-19: results from hospitalized patients of a hotspot region for SARS-CoV-2 infections(rerun),"S., Budweiser; S., Bas; R.A., Jorres; S., Engelhardt; S., von Delius; K., Lenherr; J., Deerberg-Wittram; , Bauer A","Background: In hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, outcomes markedly differ between locations, regions and countries. One possible cause for these variations in outcomes could be differences in patient treatment limitations (PTL) in different locations. We thus studied their role as predictor for mortality in a population of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Method(s): In a region with high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, adult hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively registered and characterized regarding sex, age, vital signs, symptoms, comorbidities (including Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)), transcutaneous pulse oximetry (SpO2) and laboratory values upon admission, as well as ICU-stay including respiratory support, discharge, transfer to another hospital and death. PTL assessed by routine clinical procedures comprised the acceptance of ICU-therapy, orotracheal intubation and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Result(s): Among 526 patients included (median [quartiles] age 73 [57; 82] years, 47% female), 226 (43%) had at least one treatment limitation. Each limitation was associated with age, dementia and eGFR (p < 0.05 each), that regarding resuscitation additionally with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and cardiac disease. Overall mortality was 27% and lower (p < 0.001) in patients without treatment limitation (12%) compared to those with any limitation (47%). In univariate analyses, age and comorbidities (diabetes, cardiac, cerebrovascular, renal, hepatic, malignant disease, dementia), SpO2, hemoglobin, leucocyte numbers, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 and LDH were predictive for death (p < 0.05 each). In multivariate analyses, the presence of any treatment limitation was an independent predictor of death (OR 4.34, 95%-CI 2.10-12.30; p = 0.001), in addition to CCI, eGFR < 55 ml/min, neutrophil number > 5 G/l, CRP > 7 mg/l and SpO2 < 93% (p < 0.05 each). Conclusion(s): In hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, the percentage of patients with treatment limitations was high. PTL were linked to age, comorbidities and eGFR assessed upon admission and strong, independent risk factors for mortality. These findings might be useful for further understanding of COVID-19 mortality and its regional variations.

Objective(s): To assess factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This multicenter cohort study assessed 2215 adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 65 hospitals across the US from March 4 to April 4, 2020. Exposures: Patient-level data, including demographics, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction, and hospital characteristics, including number of ICU beds. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes. Result(s): A total of 2215 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [14.5] years; 1436 [64.8%] male; 1738 [78.5%] with at least 1 chronic comorbidity) were included in the study. At 28 days after ICU admission, 784 patients (35.4%) had died, 824 (37.2%) were discharged, and 607 (27.4%) remained hospitalized. At the end of study follow-up (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 8-28 days), 875 patients (39.5%) had died, 1203 (54.3%) were discharged, and 137 (6.2%) remained hospitalized. Factors independently associated with death included older age (=80 vs <40 years of age: odds ratio [OR], 11.15; 95% CI, 6.19-20.06), male sex (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19-1.90), higher body mass index (=40 vs <25: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25), coronary artery disease (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-2.02), active cancer (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.35-3.43), and the presence of hypoxemia (Pao2:Fio2<100 vs =300 mm Hg: OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.11-4.08), liver dysfunction (liver Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 2-4 vs 0: OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.30-5.25), and kidney dysfunction (renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 vs 0: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.46-4.05) at ICU admission. Patients admitted to hospitals with fewer ICU beds had a higher risk of death (<50 vs =100 ICU beds: OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.16-4.99). Hospitals varied considerably in the risk-adjusted proportion of patients who died (range, 6.6%-80.8%) and in the percentage of patients who received hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and other treatments and supportive therapies.

However, there is a lack of information on the characteristics of this disease in the Spanish population. The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our geographical area. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, in Reus, Spain, admitted between 15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data, signs and symptoms and comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 +/- 13.1 vs. 62.8 +/- 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors. This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, and one of the few in the Mediterranean area.

Characteristics and outcomes of latinx patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other ethnic and racial groups(rerun),"S., Izzy; Z., Tahir; D.J., Cote; A., Al Jarrah; M.B., Roberts; S., Turbett; A., Kadar; S.M., Smirnakis; S.K., Feske; R., Zafonte; J.A., Fishman; , El Khoury J","Background. There is a limited understanding of the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Latinx population. We hypothesized that Latinx patients would be more likely to be hospitalized and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) than White patients. Methods. We analyzed all patients with COVID-19 in 12 Massachusetts hospitals between February 1 and April 14, 2020. We examined the association between race, ethnicity, age, reported comorbidities, and hospitalization and ICU admission using multivariable regression. Results. Of 5190 COVID-19 patients, 29% were hospitalized; 33% required the ICU, and 4.3% died. Forty-six percent of patients were White, 25% Latinx, 14% African American, and 3% Asian American. Ethnicity and race were significantly associated with hospitalization. More Latinx and African American patients in the younger age groups were hospitalized than whites. Latinxs and African Americans disproportionally required the ICU, with 39% of hospitalized Latinx patients requiring the ICU compared with 33% of African Americans, 24% of Asian Americans, and 30% of Whites (P < .007). Within each ethnic and racial group, age and male gender were independently predictive of hospitalization. Previously reported preexisting comorbidities contributed to the need for hospitalization in all racial and ethnic groups (P < .05). However, the observed disparities were less likely related to reported comorbidities, with Latinx and African American patients being admitted at twice the rate of Whites, regardless of such comorbidities. Conclusions. Latinx and African American patients with COVID-19 have higher rates of hospitalization and ICU admission than White patients. The etiologies of such disparities are likely multifactorial and cannot be explained only by reported comorbidities.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.",2020,,Open forum infectious diseases,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa401,,#73021,S 2020,Fazal Shah (2023-11-05 09:17:16)(Select): COVID diagnosed via RNA testing; 342 patients with malignancy and cancer; Table 5 reports multivariate logistic regression model ORs predicting ICU admission among hospitalized patients With COVID-19 and malignancy stratified by race - can we combine these into one OR for whole cohort (or just input separately into meta-analysis)?; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious patients with compatible chest computed tomography features. Cardiac injury was defined as a rise of serum high sensitivity cardiac Troponin-I level above 99th percentile (men:>26 ng/mL, women:>11 ng/mL). A total of 386 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Cardiac injury was present among 115 (29.8%) of the study population. The development of cardiac injury was significantly associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those with normal troponin levels (40.9% vs 11.1%, p value<0.001). It was shown that patients with cardiac injury had a significantly lower survival rate after a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset (p log-rank<0.001). It was further demonstrated in the multivariable analysis that cardiac injury could possibly increase the risk of short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (HR=1.811, p-value=0.023). Additionally, preexisting cardiovascular disease, malignancy, blood oxygen saturation <90%, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia at presentation were independently associated with a greater risk of developing cardiac injury. Development of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality and poor in-hospital outcomes. Additionally, it was shown that development of cardiac injury was associated with a lower short-term survival rate compared to patients without myocardial damage and could independently increase the risk of short-term mortality by nearly two-fold.",2020,,Internal and emergency medicine,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02466-1,,#73023,S 2020,Anita Patel (2023-11-06 06:36:51)(Select): cancer as comorbidity (cancer = 17 vs. 369).

In addition, there is a lack of data for young adults. This study was conducted to assess risk factors predicting COVID-19 severity and mortality in hospitalized young adults. A retrospective observational study was conducted at two centers from China and India on COVID-19 patients aged 20-50 years. Regression analysis to predict adverse outcomes was performed using parameters including age, sex, country of origin, hospitalization duration, comorbidities, lymphocyte count, and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) score at admission. A total of 420 patients (172 East Asians and 248 South Asians) were included. The predictive model for intensive care unit (ICU) admission with variables NEWS2 Category II and higher, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, and low lymphocyte counts had an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.930 with a sensitivity of 0.931 and a specificity of 0.784. The predictive model for mortality with NEWS2 Category III, cancer, and decreasing lymphocyte count had an AUC value of 0.883 with a sensitivity of 0.903 and a specificity of 0.701.

Impact of comorbidity burden on mortality in patients with COVID-19 using the Korean health insurance database(rerun),"S.I., Cho; S., Yoon; , Lee H.-J.","We aimed to investigate the impact of comorbidity burden on mortality in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We analyzed the COVID-19 data from the nationwide health insurance claims of South Korea. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and mortality records of patients with COVID-19 were extracted from the database. The odds ratios of mortality according to comorbidities in these patients with and without adjustment for age and sex were calculated. The predictive value of the original Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) for mortality in these patients were investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among 7590 patients, 227 (3.0%) had died. After age and sex adjustment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. The ROC curve analysis showed that an ACCI threshold>3.5 yielded the best cut-off point for predicting mortality (area under the ROC 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.94).

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Daegu. METHOD(S): In collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City and Korean Center for Diseases Control, we conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including viral RNA detection, were obtained from the electronic medical records and cohort database and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariate and multi-variable logistic regression methods and Cox regression model and performed Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the risk factors associated with the 28-day mortality and release from isolation among the patients. RESULT(S): In this study, 7,057 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 (total cohort) who had been diagnosed from February 18 to July 10, 2020 were included. Of the total cohort, 5,467 were asymptomatic to mild patients (77.4%) (asymptomatic 30.6% and mild 46.8%), 985 moderate (14.0%), 380 severe (5.4%), and 225 critical (3.2%). The mortality of the patients was 2.5% (179/7,057). The Cox regression hazard model for the patients with available clinical information (core cohort) (n = 2,254) showed the risk factors for 28-day mortality: age > 70 (hazard ratio [HR], 4.219, P = 0.002), need for O2 supply at admission (HR, 2.995; P = 0.001), fever (> 37.5degreeC) (HR, 2.808; P = 0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.119; P = 0.008), cancer (HR, 3.043; P = 0.011), dementia (HR, 5.252; P = 0.008), neurological disease (HR, 2.084; P = 0.039), heart failure (HR, 3.234; P = 0.012), and hypertension (HR, 2.160; P = 0.017). The median duration for release from isolation was 33 days (interquartile range, 24.0-46.0) in survivors. The Cox proportional hazard model for the long duration of isolation included severity, age > 70, and dementia. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, asymptomatic to mild patients were approximately 77% of the total cohort (asymptomatic, 30.6%). The case fatality rate was 2.5%.

Age-specific mortality rates were 0.9% (2/215) for 0-4 years; 0% (0/112) for 5-9 years; 0% (1/498) for 10-19 years; 0.8% (11/1,385) for 20-29 years; 0.9% (12/1,382) for 30-39 years; 2.1% (23/1,095) for 40-49 years; 5.4% (57/1,064) for 50-59 years; 10.8% (62/576) for 60-69 years; 15.9% (37/232) for >=70 years. Older age, pre-existing diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver diseases, malignancy, and pneumonia were associated with higher risk of mortality and hospitalisation. Pre-existing hypertension, cardiac diseases, COPD, and immunocompromised condition were associated with risk of hospitalisation but not with mortality. There was no association between province-level density of healthcare workers with mortality and hospitalisation., CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation was associated with higher age, pre-existing chronic comorbidities, and clinical pneumonia. The findings highlight the need for prioritising enhanced context-specific public health action to reduce mortality and hospitalisation risk among older and comorbid rural populations.

Clinical characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 infection and disease severity: A nationwide observational study in Estonia(rerun),"T., Meister; H., Pisarev; R., Kolde; R., Kalda; K., Suija; L., Milani; L., Karo-Astover; M., Piirsoo; , Uuskula A","Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to overloading of health systems all over the world. For reliable risk stratification, knowledge on factors predisposing to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to severe COVID-19 disease course is needed for decision-making at the individual, provider, and government levels. Data to identify these factors should be easily obtainable. Methods and findings Retrospective cohort study of nationwide e-health databases in Estonia. We used longitudinal health records from 66,295 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 26 February 2020 to 28 February 2021 and 254,958 randomly selected controls from the reference population with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or clinical COVID-19 diagnosis (case to control ratio 1:4) to predict risk factors of infection and severe course of COVID-19. We analysed sociodemographic and health characteristics of study participants. The SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was slightly higher among women, and was higher among those with comorbid conditions or obesity. Dementia (RRR 3.77, 95%CI 3.30-4.31), renal disease (RRR 1.88, 95%CI 1.56-2.26), and cerebrovascular disease (RRR 1.81, 95%CI 1.64-2.00) increased the risk of infection. Of all SARS-CoV-2 infected people, 92% had a non-severe disease course, 4.8% severe disease (requiring hospitalisation), 1.7% critical disease (needing intensive care), and 1.5% died. Male sex, increasing age and comorbid burden contributed significantly to more severe COVID-19, and the strength of association for male sex increased with the increasing severity of COVID-19 outcome. The strongest contributors to critical illness (expressed as RRR with 95% CI) were renal disease (7.71, 4.71-12.62), the history of previous myocardial infarction (3.54, 2.49-5.02) and obesity (3.56, 2.82-4.49). The strongest contributors to a lethal outcome were renal disease (6.48, 3.74-11.23), cancer (3.81, 3.06-4.75), liver disease (3.51, 1.36-9.02) and cerebrovascular disease (3.00, 2.31-3.89). Conclusions We found divergent effect of age and gender on infection risk and severity of COVID-19. Age and gender did not contribute substantially to infection risk, but did so for the risk of severe disease Co-morbid health conditions, especially those affecting renin-angiotensin system, had an impact on both the risk of infection and severe disease course. Age and male sex had the most significant impact on the risk of severe COVID-19. Taking into account the role of ACE2 receptors in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its modulating action on the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular and renal diseases, further research is needed to investigate the influence of hormonal status on ACE2 expression in different tissues, which may be the basis for the development of COVID-19 therapies.

Although a large body of data has been published regarding the socalled first wave of the pandemic, little is known about the characteristics and predictors of worse outcomes of patients managed in IMUs during the second wave. Methods We prospectively assessed demographics, comorbidities, treatment and outcomes, including ventilation support (VS) and death, in patients admitted to our IMU for SARS-CoV-2 between October 13th, 2020 and January 21st, 2021. Clinical evolution and biochemical testing 1, 7 and 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis were recorded. Results We studied 120 patients (M/F 56/64, age 71+/-14.5 years) admitted to our IMU. Most of them had at least one comorbidity (80%). Patients who died were older, more frequently underweight, affected by malignant neoplasms and on statin therapy compared to patients eventually discharged. Both worse outcome groups (VS and death) presented higher neutrophils, ferritin, IL-6 and lower total proteins levels than controls. Age was significantly associated with mortality but not with VS need. The multivariate analysis showed age and gender independent association of mortality with underweight, malignancy and antibiotics use at the admission. With regard to biochemical parameters, both unfavourable outcomes were positively associated with high WBC count, neutrophils, blood urea nitrogen and low serum total proteins. Conclusions Our study identified inflammation, underweight, malignancy and a marked catabolic state as the main predictors for worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients admitted to IMU during the so-called second wave of the pandemic.Copyright Â© 2022 Guglielmi et al.

Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N=3273), we estimated HR for both discharge and death across various explanatory variables, including patient demographics, hospital site and unit, smoking status, vital signs, lab results and comorbidities., RESULTS: Hispanics (29%) and African Americans (25%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to their representation in the overall NYC population (p<0.05); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in hospitalised patients based on race. Outcomes differed significantly between hospitals (Gray's T=248.9; p<0.05), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR 0.985, 95% CI 0.982 to 0.988; p=1.57e-17), care in intensive care unit areas (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.92; p=7.81e-6) and elevated creatinine (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.10; p=7.48e-10), white cell count (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p=8.4e-3) and body mass index (BMI) (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03; p=1.09e-2). Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation., CONCLUSIONS: While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find racial disparities in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. In addition, we identified key clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk of a severe infection response and predict survival. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

"Epidemiological, imaging, laboratory, and clinical characteristics and factors related to mortality in patients with covid-19: A single-center study(rerun)","Z., Azarkar; H., Salehiniya; T., Kazemi; , Abbaszadeh H","Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel pandemic. Considerable differences in disease severity and the mortality rate have been observed in different parts of the world. The present study investigated the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Iran. Method(s): We established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Iran. Epidemiological, imaging, laboratory, and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded from medical documents. The chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. A p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Result(s): In total, 364 cases (207 males and 157 females) were analyzed. The most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. Multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral distribution were the predominant imaging finding. The mean age of patients was 54.28+/-18.81 years. The mean age of patients who died was 71.50+/-14.60 years. The mortality rate was 17.6%. The total proportion of patients with a comorbidity was 47.5%, and 84.4% of patients who died had a comorbidity. Sex, history of diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were not significantly associated with mortality (p>0.05). However, mortality showed significant relationships with body mass index; age; history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary disease, and cancer; and abnormal high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings (p<0.05 for all). Cancer had the highest odds ratio. Conclusion(s): Comorbidities (especially cancer, CKD, and CVA), severe obesity, old age, and abnormal HRCT findings affected the health outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2021 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Clinical data were daily recorded. The time course of 18 clinical parameters was evaluated by a polynomial maximum likelihood multilevel linear regression model, while a full joint modeling was fit to study the association with ICU outcome., RESULTS: 1260 consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted in 24 ICUs were enrolled. 78% were male with a median age of 63 [55-69] years. At ICU admission, the median ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was 122 [89-175] mmHg. 79% of patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 34%. Both the daily values and trends of respiratory system compliance, PaO2/FiO2, driving pressure, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, creatinine, C-reactive protein, ferritin, neutrophil, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and platelets were associated with survival, while for lactate, pH, bilirubin, lymphocyte, and urea only the daily values were associated with survival. The trends of PaO2/FiO2, respiratory system compliance, driving pressure, creatinine, ferritin, and C-reactive protein showed a higher association with survival compared to the daily values., CONCLUSION: Daily values or trends over time of parameters associated with acute organ dysfunction, acid-base derangement, coagulation impairment, or systemic inflammation were associated with patient survival.

Risk of COVID-19 death in adults who received booster COVID-19 vaccinations: national retrospective cohort study on 14.6 million people in England,Ward I.; Robertson C.; Agrawal U.; Patterson L.; Bradley D.T.; Shi T.; de Lusignan S.; Hobbs R.; Sheikh A.; Nafilyan V. ,"Importance: The emergence of the COVID-19 vaccination has been critical in changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities. Objective(s): We sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): We undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 nonCOVID-19 deaths. Exposure: Sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths. Result(s): Having learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntington's disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinson's disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses. Conclusions, and Relevance: We identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The effect of COVID-19 vaccination status on all-cause mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Hungary during the delta wave of the pandemic,Horvath V.J.; Bekeffy M.; Nemeth Z.; Szelke E.; Fazekas-Pongor V.; Hajdu N.; Svebis M.M.; Pinter J.; Domjan B.A.; Meszaros S.; Korei A.E.; Kezdi A.; Kocsis I.; Kristof K.; Kempler P.; Rozgonyi F.; Takacs I.; Tabak A.G. ,"The high mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is effectively reduced by vaccination. However, the effect of vaccination on mortality among hospitalised patients is under-researched. Thus, we investigated the effect of a full primary or an additional booster vaccination on in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 during the delta wave of the pandemic. This retrospective cohort included all patients (n = 430) admitted with COVID-19 at Semmelweis University Department of Medicine and Oncology in 01/OCT/2021-15/DEC/2021. Logistic regression models were built with COVID-19-associated in-hospital/30 day-mortality as outcome with hierarchical entry of predictors of vaccination, vaccination status, measures of disease severity, and chronic comorbidities. Deceased COVID-19 patients were older and presented more frequently with cardiac complications, chronic kidney disease, and active malignancy, as well as higher levels of inflammatory markers, serum creatinine, and lower albumin compared to surviving patients (all p < 0.05). However, the rates of vaccination were similar (52-55%) in both groups. Based on the fully adjusted model, there was a linear decrease of mortality from no/incomplete vaccination (ref) through full primary (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.39-1.23) to booster vaccination (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.72, p = 0.006). Although unadjusted mortality was similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, this was explained by differences in comorbidities and disease severity. In adjusted models, a full primary and especially a booster vaccination improved survival of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 during the delta wave of the pandemic.

All the National Healthcare System information on biographical records, vaccinations, SARS-CoV-2 swabs, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and co-pay exemptions were extracted from 25 February 2020 to 15 February 2023. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to compute the relative hazards of infection and severe or lethal COVID-19, adjusting for age, gender, vaccine status, hypertension, diabetes, major cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney disease or cancer. Among the 300,079 residents or domiciled citizens, 41.5% had >=1 positive swabs during the follow-up (which lasted a mean of 932 days).

Objective(s): To determine the associations of tumor type with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This retrospective, population-based cohort study included community-dwelling adults aged at least 18 years in Ontario, Canada, ICES-linked provincial health databases from January 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to November 1, 2022. Exposures: Cancer diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, and secondary outcomes included all-cause 14-day hospitalization, 21-day ICU admission, and 28-day death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs. Result(s): Of 11732108 people in the ICES-linked health databases, 279287 had cancer (57.2% female; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [16.1] years) and 11452821 people did not have cancer (45.7% female; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [16.0] years).

Individuals with hematologic malignant neoplasms (33901 individuals) were at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13-1.25), 14-day hospitalization (aHR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.57-1.96), and 28-day mortality (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.74-2.38) compared with the overall population, while individuals with solid tumors (245386 individuals) were at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.95) but increased risk of 14-day hospitalization (aHR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18) and 28-day mortality (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.19-1.44). The 28-day mortality rate was high in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms (163 of 321 hospitalized patients [50.7%]) or solid tumors (486 of 1060 hospitalized patients [45.8%]). However, the risk of 21-day ICU admission in patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.40) or solid tumors (aHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82-1.05) was not significantly different from that among individuals without cancer. The SARS-CoV-2 infection risk decreased stepwise with increasing numbers of COVID-19 vaccine doses received (1 dose: aHR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62-0.63; 2 doses: aHR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.16-0.16; 3 doses: aHR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.04-0.06). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight the importance of prioritization strategies regarding ICU access to reduce the mortality risk in increased-risk populations, such as patients with cancer.Copyright © 2023 American Medical Association.

"Were cancer patients worse off than the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic? A population-based study from Norway, Denmark and Iceland during the pre-vaccination era",Johansson A.L.V.; Skog A.; Johannesen T.B.; Myklebust T.A.; Skovlund C.W.; Morch L.S.; Friis S.; Gamborg M.; Kristiansen M.F.; Pettersson D.; Olafsdottir E.J.; Birgisson H.; Palsson R.; Eythorsson E.; Irenaeus S.; Lambe M.; Ursin G. ,"Background: In a population-based setting, we investigated the risks of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developing severe COVID-19 outcomes among cancer patients compared with the general population. Method(s): In nationwide cohorts, we identified all individuals in Norway, Denmark and Iceland who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had a severe COVID-19 outcome (hospitalisation, intensive care, and death) from March until December 2020, using data from national health registries. We estimated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing cancer patients with the general population. Finding(s): During the first wave of the pandemic, cancer patients in Norway and Denmark had higher risks of testing SARS-CoV-2 positive compared to the general population. Throughout 2020, recently treated cancer patients were more likely to test SARS-CoV-2 positive. In Iceland, cancer patients experienced no increased risk of testing positive. The risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation was higher among cancer patients diagnosed within one year of hospitalisation (Norway: SIR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.89-3.09; Denmark: 2.23, 1.96-2.54) and within five years (Norway: 1.58, 1.35-1.83; Denmark: 1.54, 1.42-1.66). Risks were higher in recently treated cancer patients and in those diagnosed with haematologic malignancies, colorectal or lung cancer. Risks of COVID-19-related intensive care and death were higher among cancer patients. Interpretation(s): Cancer patients were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave when testing availability was limited, while relative risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes remained increased in cancer patients throughout 2020. Recent cancer treatment and haematologic malignancy were the strongest risk factors.

Long-term survival after intensive care for COVID-19: a nationwide cohort study of more than 8000 patients,Hagglof E.; Bell M.; Zettersten E.; Engerstrom L.; Larsson E. ,"Background: Was it worth it-what is the outcome after the extended ICU (intensive care unit) length of stay for COVID-19 patients? Surprisingly, data on long-term mortality in large cohorts are lacking. We investigate long-term mortality including differences between men and women, as previous studies show that men generally suffer a more severe course of COVID-19 in terms of severity of illness and short-term mortality. Method(s): Nationwide cohort including all adult COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs until August 12, 2022. Primary outcome was 360-day mortality after ICU admission. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between demographics, comorbidities, clinical characteristics and mortality. Result(s): In total, 8392 patients were included. Median (IQR) age was 63 (52-72) years and the majority (70.1%) were men. Among the 7390 patients with complete 360-day mortality data, 1775 (24.4%) patients died within 30 days, 2125 (28.8%) within 90 days and 2206 (29.8%) within 360 days from ICU admission. 360-day mortality was 27.1% in women and 31.0% in men. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed increased risk of 360-day mortality in men compared to women (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.17-1.52). Other variables associated with poor 360-day mortality were age, cardiac disease, COPD/asthma, diabetes, immune deficiency, chronic kidney disease, neuromuscular disease, and malignancy. Conclusion(s): This study confirms the increased severity of disease in critically ill men with COVID-19, even in a long-term perspective. However, mortality beyond 90 days was strikingly low, indicating high probability of survival after the acute phase of illness.Copyright © 2023, La Societe de Reanimation de Langue Francaise = The French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF).",2023,/,Annals of Intensive Care,13,1,76,2025175999,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-023-01156-3,,#73513,Hagglof 2023,"Muhammad Hasan (2023-11-03 08:50:18)(Select):  360 days mortality OR with Malignancy

Machine Learning-Based Scoring System for Early Prognosis Evaluation of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,Zhang H.-M.; Shi L.; Chen H.-R.; Zhang J.-D.; Liu G.-L.; Wang Z.-N.; Zhi P.; Wang R.-S.; Li Z.-Y.; Chen X.-M.; Wang F.-S.; Lu X.-C.; Wang H. ,"Background The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to threaten human health security, exerting considerable pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. While prognostic models for COVID-19 hospitalized or intensive care patients are currently available, prognostic models developed for large cohorts of thousands of individuals are still lacking. Methods Between February 4 and April 16, 2020, we enrolled 3,974 patients admitted with COVID-19 disease in the Wuhan Huo-Shen-Shan Hospital and the Maternal and Child Hospital, Hubei Province, China. (1) Screening of key prognostic factors: A univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on 2,649 patients in the training set, and factors affecting prognosis were initially screened. Subsequently, a random survival forest model was established through machine analysis to further screen for factors that are important for prognosis. Finally, multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the synergy among various factors related to prognosis. (2) Establishment of a scoring system: The nomogram algorithm established a COVID-19 patient death risk assessment scoring system for the nine selected key prognostic factors, calculated the C index, drew calibration curves and drew training set patient survival curves. (3) Verification of the scoring system: The scoring system assessed 1,325 patients in the test set, splitting them into high- and low-risk groups, calculated the C-index, and drew calibration and survival curves. Results The cross-sectional study found that age, clinical classification, sex, pulmonary insufficiency, hypoproteinemia, and four other factors (underlying diseases: blood diseases, malignant tumor; complications: digestive tract bleeding, heart dysfunction) have important significance for the prognosis of the enrolled patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the discovery of the effects of hypoproteinemia and hematological diseases on the prognosis of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the scoring system established here can effectively evaluate objective scores for the early prognoses of patients with COVID-19 and can divide them into high- and low-risk groups (using a scoring threshold of 117.77, a score below which is considered low risk). The efficacy of the system was better than that of clinical classification using the current COVID-19 guidelines (C indexes, 0.95 vs. 0.89). Conclusions Age, clinical typing, sex, pulmonary insufficiency, hypoproteinemia, and four other factors were important for COVID-19 survival. Compared with general statistical methods, this method can quickly and accurately screen out the relevant factors affecting prognosis, provide an order of importance, and establish a scoring system based on the nomogram model, which is of great clinical significance.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study in Southwestern Iran,Ahmadi M.; Zarei J.; Hadianfard A.M.; Moghadam T.N. ,"Background. Diabetes is one of the most common diseases among hospitalized patients due to COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of diabetic and non-diabetic patients with COVID-19 that may lead to death. Methods. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among patients admitted to hospitals due to COVID-19. The data, including demographic data, symptoms and signs, underlying diseases, patient progress, and outcomes were obtained from 38 hospitals in the registry system of Khuzestan province (the southwest of Iran) between January 19, 2020 and March 8, 2021. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the data. Results. Data from 23,447 hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 were included in the study. Four thousand three hundred and forty participants (18.5%) with a mean age of 62 years had diabetes and 14.72% of them died. A multivarible Cox regression showed that the variables of age (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.78- 3.95; P < 0.001), sex (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.001 - 1.35; P = 0.049) and comorbidities such as cancer (HR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.24 - 2.89; P = 0.003) and cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.24 - 2.89; P = 0.032) were associated with mortality in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Conclusion. This study showed that COVID-19 mortality was higher in men, the elderly, and people with cardiovascular disease and cancer. Therefore, the management and prevention of COVID-19 in diabetic patients with these characteristics are vital.Copyright © 2023 Sciendo.

However, the SARS-CoV-2 phenotype evolution in patients with cancer since 2020 has not previously been described. We therefore evaluated SARS-CoV-2 on a UK populationscale from 01/11/2020-31/08/2022, assessing case-outcome rates of hospital assessment(s), intensive care admission and mortality. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 disease phenotype has become less severe in patients with cancer and the non-cancer population. Case-hospitalisation rates for patients with cancer dropped from 30.58% in early 2021 to 7.45% in 2022 while case-mortality rates decreased from 20.53% to 3.25%. However, the risk of hospitalisation and mortality remains 2.10x and 2.54x higher in patients with cancer, respectively. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 disease phenotype is less severe in 2022 compared to 2020 but patients with cancer remain at higher risk than the non-cancer population. Patients with cancer must therefore be empowered to live more normal lives, to see loved ones and families, while also being safeguarded with expanded measures to reduce the risk of transmission.Copyright © 2023.

Mortality Rate and Effects of COVID-19 in Cancer Patients versus Non-cancer Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Study,Ghadamgahi F.; Safari M.; Faradmal J.; Bashirian S.; Soltanian A.R.; Khazaei S.; Roshanaei G. ,"Background and Aim: Coronavirus is still a life-threatening disease around the world. In patients with this disease, having an underlying disease reduces the effectiveness of treatment and increases mortality. This study aimed to examine the effect of cancer history on mortality rates in patients with COVID-19. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was a case-control study involving 60 cancer patients with COVID-19 as the case group and 180 non-cancer patients with COVID-19 as the control group. A matching method based on propensity score was used to select patients in the control group. The effect of treatment on the outcome (recovery death) was studied with logistic regression, and the factors affecting patient survival were analyzed with Cox models. R software was used to analyze the data. Result(s): The mean (SD) age of patients in the case and control groups was 61.37 (13.47) and 63.19 (13.95) years, respectively. In the case group, 37 patients (61.7%), and in the control group, 114 patients (63.3%) were male. 23 cancer patients (38.3%) and 26 non-cancer patients (14.4%) died. The results of logistic regression as well as the Cox model showed the variables of age, blood oxygen level (SpO2), admission to the intensive care unit, and cancer history as significant for patient death (P <0.05). Conclusion(s): To study the effect of demographic, clinical, and laboratory results on the risk of death among COVID-19 patients with and without a cancer history, control group in this study was selected by PSM method. The results of this study have indicated cancer history to be one of the factors affecting the mortality of patients with COVID-19 in addition to age variables, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).Copyright © 2023 Ghadamgahi et al.",2023,/,Open Public Health Journal,16,"(Ghadamgahi) Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran, Islamic Republic of(Safari) Department of Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran, Islamic",e187494452305260,2024752659,https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/18749445-v16-230621-2022-153,,#73818,Ghadamgahi 2023,"",cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed for now); true cancer vs non-cancer

Method(s): This was a territory-wide retrospective study to investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hyponatremia from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022 in Hong Kong. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality of patients with COVID-19 and hyponatremia at presentation. Secondary outcomes included rate of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, overall duration of hospitalization, and duration of ICU hospitalization. Result(s): A total of 53,415 COVID-19 patients were included for analysis, of which 14,545 (27.2%) had hyponatremia at presentation. 9813 (67.5%), 2821 (19.4%), and 1911 (13.1%) had mild (130 to <135 mmol/L), moderate (125 to <130 mmol/L), and severe hyponatremia (<125 mmol/L) at presentation respectively. Age, male sex, diabetes, active malignancy, white cell count, serum creatinine, hypoalbuminemia, C-reactive protein, and viral loads were independent predictors for hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001, for all). Hyponatremic patients had increased 30-day mortality (9.7 vs. 5.7%, P < 0.001), prolonged hospitalization (11.9 +/- 15.1 days vs. 11.5 +/- 12.1 days, P < 0.001), and more ICU admissions (7.0% vs. 3.3%, P < 0.001). Patients diagnosed during the ""fifth wave"" Omicron BA.2 outbreak had 2.29-fold risk (95% CI 2.02-2.59, P < 0.001) of presenting with hyponatremia compared to other waves. Conclusion(s): Hyponatremia is common among COVID-19 patients, and may serve as a prognostic indicator for unfavorable outcomes and increased healthcare utilization in the evolving COVID-19 outbreak.Copyright © 2023 Chan, Wong, So, Ng, Lui, Szeto, Hung, Tse, Tang, Chan, Chow and Yap.",2023,/,Frontiers in Medicine,9,"(Chan, Ng, Szeto) Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong(Wong, Tse, Yap) Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The Un",1096165,2021235154,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.1096165,,#74447,Chan 2023,"Mark Cheng (2023-11-04 10:47:21)(Included): thanks for including this.

"Development of a multivariable model predicting mortality risk from comorbidities in an italian cohort of 18,286 confirmed covid-19 cases aged 40 years or older",Andreano A.; Murtas R.; Tunesi S.; Gervasi F.; Magnoni P.; Russo A.G. ,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a risk prediction model for 30-day mortality from COVID-19 in an Italian cohort aged 40 years or older. DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The cohort included all swab positive cases aged 40 years older (No. 18,286) among residents in the territory of the Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) up to 27.04.2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the ATS administrative database of chronic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To predict 30-day mortality risk, a multivariable logistic regression model, including age, gender, and the selected conditions, was developed following the TRIPOD guidelines. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed. RESULT(S): After age and gender, the most important predictors of 30-day mortality were diabetes, tumour in first-line treatment, chronic heart failure, and complicated diabetes. The bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78, which suggests that this model is useful in predicting death after COVID-19 infection in swab positive cases. The model had good discrimination (Brier score 0.13) and was well calibrated (Index of prediction accuracy of 14.8%). CONCLUSION(S): A risk prediction model for 30-day mortality in a large COVID-19 cohort aged 40 years or older was developed. In a new epidemic wave, it would help to define groups at different risk and to identify high-risk subjects to target for specific prevention and therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2021, Inferenze Scarl.

"Clinical, demographical characteristics and hospitalisation of 3,010 patients with covid-19 in friuli venezia giulia region (Northern italy). a multivariate, population-based, statistical analysis",Gobbato M.; Clagnan E.; Burba I.; Rizzi L.; Grassetti L.; Del Zotto S.; Dal Maso L.; Serraino D.; Tonutti G. ,"OBJECTIVES: to describe the clinical and demographical characteristics of COVID-19 infected people in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (FVG, Northern Italy). DESIGN: retrospective cohort study with an individual level record linkage procedure of different administrative data-bases. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included 3,010 patients residing in FVG who tested positive for COVID-19 between 1 March and 15 May 2020, 2020. Regional hospital admissions and deaths without hospital admissions up to June 1st, 2020 were analysed. Determinants of the probability of a highly severe illness were investigated in terms of hos-pitalisations or death without hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 patients were identified from regional epidemiological data warehouse. Demographical and clinical variables such as gender, age, pa-tient's comorbidities, vaccinations, ARBs/sartans prescriptions, and geographical residence variables were collected by linking different databases. Descriptive analyses were performed. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate the probability of hospitalisation or death, whichever came first. Model coefficients and odds ratios (OR) were reported. RESULT(S): COVID-19 population in FVG had a mean age of 60 years and 59% were females. The study found that 37% had hypertension while patients with cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and cancer were around 15%; 22% of the cases were residing in retirement homes. Approximately 30% re-ceived flu or pneumococcal vaccination and a similar propor-tion of patients had at least one prescription of ARBs /sar-tans in the previous 6 months. Statistical models showed a higher probability of a worst course of disease for males, el-derly, highly complicated (in terms of resource use) subjects, in the presence of cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and pneu-mococcal vaccination. People living in retirement homes had a lower probability of hospitalisation/death without hospital admission. The cohort was divided into two groups: COV-ID-19 patients infected in the territory and infected in retirement homes. Among COVID-19 patients infected in the ter-ritory, the probability of hospitalisation/death was higher for males, for older individuals, and for those with comorbidities. Diabetes resulted to be a risk factor (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.23-2.62), as well as pneumococcal vaccination (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.18-2.29), which is a likely proxy of fragile patients with pulmonary disease. The flu vaccination showed a potential protective effect with a 40% lower probability of hospitalisation or death (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.44-0.85). Among the retirement homes cohort group, a higher probability of a bad course of disease emerged for males and for more complex patients. CONCLUSION(S): the greatest risk of hospitalisation/death as a measure of more severe illness was confirmed for males, el-derly, and for individuals with comorbidities.

Mortality in cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 or seasonal influenza: an observational cohort study from a German-wide hospital network,Kodde C.; Bonsignore M.; Schondube D.; Bauer T.; Hohenstein S.; Bollmann A.; Meier-Hellmann A.; Kuhlen R.; Nachtigall I. ,"Purpose: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was often compared to seasonal influenza. We aimed to compare the outcome of hospitalized patients with cancer infected by SARS-CoV-2 or seasonal influenza including intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Method(s): We analyzed claims data of patients with a lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or seasonal influenza infection admitted to one of 85 hospitals of a German-wide hospital network between January 2016 and August 2021. Result(s): 29,284 patients with COVID-19 and 7442 patients with seasonal influenza were included. Of these, 360 patients with seasonal influenza and 1625 patients with COVID-19 had any kind of cancer. Cancer patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit than cancer patients with seasonal influenza (29.4% vs 24.7%; OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.00-1.73 p <.05). No statistical significance was observed in the mechanical ventilation rate for cancer patients with COVID-19 compared to those with seasonal influenza (17.2% vs 13.6% OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96-1.86 p =.09). 34.9% of cancer patients with COVID-19 and 17.9% with seasonal influenza died (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.81-3.32 p <.01). Risk factors among cancer patients with COVID-19 or seasonal influenza for in-hospital mortality included the male gender, age, a higher Elixhauser comorbidity index and metastatic cancer. Conclusion(s): Among cancer patients, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a higher risk for in-hospital mortality than seasonal influenza. These findings underline the need of protective measurements to prevent an infection with either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza, especially in this high-risk population.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",2023,/,Infection,51,1,119-127,2017632234,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15010-022-01852-5,35657531 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=35657531],#74954,Kodde 2023,"Abigail Burn (2023-11-06 00:29:40)(Select): ""An analysis restricted to in-hospital care for those in

Method(s): This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients who presented to Hong Kong public hospitals between 1 January 2020 and 8 December 2020. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of requirement for intubation, ICU admission and 30-day mortality. Result(s): The following study consisted of 6089 COVID-19 patients (median age 45.9 [27.8.1-62.7] years; 50% male), of which 142 were cancer subjects. COVID-19 cancer patients were older at baseline and tended to present with a higher frequency of comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation and gastrointestinal bleeding (p < 0.05). These subjects also likewise tended to present with higher serum levels of inflammatory markers, including D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin-I and C-reactive protein. Multivariate Cox regression showed that any type of cancer presented with an almost four-fold increased risk of the primary outcome (HR: 3.77; 95% CI: 1.63-8.72; p < 0.002) after adjusting for significant demographics, Charlson comorbidity index, number of comorbidities, past comorbidities and medication history. This association remained significant when assessing those with colorectal (HR: 5.07; 95% CI: 1.50-17.17; p < 0.009) and gastrointestinal malignancies (HR: 3.79; 95% CI: 1.12-12.88; p < 0.03), but not with lung, genitourinary, or breast malignancies, relative to their respective cancer-free COVID-19 counterparts.

Comparing the COVID-19 Mortality Rate in Cancer Patients with and Without a History of Chemotherapy,Bazgir N.; Taghinezhad F.; Nourmohammadi H.; Azami G.; Ahmadi I.; Mozafari A. ,"Background: Patients with cancer are potentially vulnerable to COVID-19 infection due to the immune-compromised state of cancer or its treatment complications. Objective(s): This study compared the COVID-19 mortality rate in cancer patients with and without a history of chemotherapy. Method(s): This registry-based cohort study launched from March 2020 to March 2021 contains 2350 records in which 64 COVID-19 patients with cancer were included, of which 27 patients underwent the chemotherapy plan within eight weeks before confirmed COVID-19. In addition, age and sex were matched in patients without a history of cancer as a control group. Two groups of cancer patients with and without a history of chemotherapy compared to the control group using cox proportional hazard regression models in Stata.10 software. Result(s): Patients with cancer had a higher hazard for in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 infection (adjusted HR; 2.27, 95% CI: 1.25-4.13, P = 0.007) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and co-morbidities. Our result showed no significant association between chemotherapy and control groups (adjusted HR; 1.65, 95% CI: 0.60-4.56, P = 0.33).

A cross-sectional study was conducted at Eka Kotebe General Hospital, Ethiopia's first COVID-19 treatment center. All consecutive symptomatic SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals, aged 18 and older, admitted to the hospital between March 13 and September 16, 2020, were included. Of the total 463 cases, 319 (68.9%) were male. The median age was 45 years (interquartile range 32-62). The most common three symptoms were cough (69%), shortness of breath (SOB; 44%), and fatigue (37%). Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus. The age groups 40 to 59 and $ 60 were more likely to have severe disease compared with those,40 years of age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]53.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-6.31 and aOR53.46, 95% CI: 1.91-6.90, respectively).

The age group $ 60 was significantly associated with greater in-hospital mortality compared with those,40 years. In addition, the presence of any malignancy, SOB, and vomiting were associated with higher odds of mortality. In Ethiopia, most COVID-19 patients were male and presented with cough, SOB, and fatigue.

Sex differences in determinants of COVID-19 severe outcomes - findings from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C),Yoshida Y.; Chu S.; Fox S.; Zu Y.; Lovre D.; Denson J.L.; Miele L.; Mauvais-Jarvis F. ,"Objective: The impact of comorbidities and biomarkers on COVID-19 severity vary by sex but have not yet been verified in population-based studies. We examined the association of comorbidities, inflammatory biomarkers, and severe outcomes in men and women hospitalized for COVID-19. Design(s): This is a retrospective cohort analysis based on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). We included 574,391 adult patients admitted for COVID-19 at hospitals or emergency rooms between 01/01/2020 and 12/31/2021. Method(s): We defined comorbidities at or before the first admission for COVID-19 by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and CCI components. We used the averaged lab values taken within 15 days before or after the admission date to measure biomarkers including c-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT proBNP), d-dimer, absolute lymphocyte counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and platelets. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and hospital length of stay (LOS). We used logistic regression adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, visit type, and medications to assess the association of comorbidities, biomarkers, and mortality disaggregating by sex. Result(s): Moderate to severe liver disease, renal disease, metastatic solid tumor, and myocardial infarction were the top four fatal comorbidities among patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] > 2). These four comorbid conditions remained the most lethal in both sexes, with a higher magnitude of risk in women than in men (p-interaction < 0.05). Abnormal elevations of CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin, NT proBNP, neutrophil, and platelet counts, and lymphocytopenia were significantly associated with the risk of death, with procalcitonin and NT proBNP as the strongest predictors (aOR > 2). The association between the abnormal biomarkers and death was stronger in women than in men (p-interaction < 0.05). Conclusion(s): There are sex differences in inpatient mortality associated with comorbidities and biomarkers. The significant impact of these clinical determinants in women with COVID-19 may be underappreciated as previous studies stressed the increased death rate in male patients that is related to comorbidities or inflammation.

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection According to Previous Metabolic Status and Its Association with Mortality and Post-Acute COVID-19,de Arriba Fernandez A.; Alonso Bilbao J.L.; Espineira Frances A.; Cabeza Mora A.; Gutierrez Perez A.; Diaz Barreiros M.A.; Serra Majem L. ,"Background. SARS-CoV-2 infection was analyzed according to previous metabolic status and its association with mortality and post-acute COVID-19. Methods. A population-based observational retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of 110,726 patients aged 12 years or more who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between June 1st, 2021, and 28 February 2022 on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain. Results. In the 347 patients who died, the combination of advanced age, male sex, cancer, immunosuppressive therapy, coronary heart disease, elevated total cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was strongly predictive of mortality (p < 0.05). In the 555 patients who developed post-acute COVID-19, the persistence of symptoms was most frequent in women, older subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, asthma, elevated fasting glucose levels or elevated total cholesterol (p < 0.05). A complete vaccination schedule was associated with lower mortality (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.5, 95%CI 0.39-0.64; p < 0.05) and post-acute COVID-19 (IRR 0.37, 95%CI 0.31-0.44; p < 0.05).

Renin-angiotensin system modulators and other risk factors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension: a Korean perspective,Kim H.-S.; Kang M.; Kang G. ,"Background: While hypertension is the most common comorbid condition in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Korea, there is a lack of studies investigating risk factors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension in Korea. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects risk factors in hypertensive Korean COVID-19 patients. Method(s): We selected patients from the database of the project #OpenData4Covid19. This information was linked to their 3-year historical healthcare data. The severity of the disease was classified into five levels. We also clustered the levels into two grades. Result(s): The risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity were old age, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and renal replacement therapy. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) both before and after a diagnosis of COVID-19 were not associated with COVID-19 severity. A multivariate analysis revealed that old age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were risk factors for severe COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that in hypertensive patients with COVID-19, older age, male sex, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were risk factors for a severe clinical course. In addition, the use of ARBs and ACEIs before or after COVID-19 infection did not affect a patient's risk of contracting COVID-19 nor did it contribute to a worse prognosis for the disease. These results highlighted that precautions should be considered for hypertensive patients with those risk factors and do not support discontinuation of ARBs and ACEIs during COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,/,BMC Infectious Diseases,21,1,175,2010488094,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-05848-8,33588797 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33588797],#77985,Kim 2021,"Anushka Irodi (2023-11-05 09:30:24)(Select): Cancer as a comorbidity group (n=1775 out of n=7590) with multivariate regression analysis given in Table 5.; Fazal Shah (2023-11-05 04:48:07)(Select): COVID confirmed via PCR;  1775 patients with cancer and COVID; outcomes of interest stratified by cancer status in Table 4 (oxygen status, death) - given in raw figures rather than HR/OR; Table 5 gives multivariate analysis for COVID severity and mortality by cancer status; ",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments
Comparison of comorbidities in relation to critical conditions among coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A network meta-analysis,Hoang T.; Anh T.T.T. ,"Severe illness and poor outcome are mainly associated with aging or certain medical comorbidities, especially chronic diseases. However, factors for unfavorable prognosis have not been well described owing to relatively small sample sizes and single-center reports. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the contribution of comorbidities in the development of critical conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Pooled estimates of relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by conducting a meta-analysis and network meta-analysis of 18 studies. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most strongly associated with the overall critical condition (RR = 4.22, 95% CI = 3.12 - 5.69), followed by cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 3.00, 95% CI = 2.41 - 3.73), malignancy (RR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.16 - 3.91), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (RR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.95 - 4.19), diabetes (RR = 2.10, 95% CI = 2.16 - 3.91), hypertension (RR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.82 - 2.23), and chronic kidney disease (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.36 - 2.94). The presence of comorbidities except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease significantly increased the risk of severe infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cardiac injury in the subgroup analysis by types of critical conditions. Preexisting hypertension and diabetes additionally increased the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among comorbidities, COPD had the highest probability of leading to severe COVID-19, ICU admission, and liver injury, while malignancy was most likely to cause ARDS and cardiac injury. In summary, preexisting COPD, CVD, CVA, hypertension, diabetes, and malignancy are more likely to worsen the progression of COVID-19, with severe infection, ICU admission requirement, and cardiac injury development. isi ProvisionalCopyright © 2021 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Korean Society for Antimicrobial Therapy, and The Korean Society for AIDS This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD [hazards ratio (HR) 2.681, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.424-5.048], diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were risk factors of reaching to the composite endpoints. The HR was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. Conclusion(s): Among laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2020 European Respiratory Society.

Risk factors for ILA development and duration of ILA persistence after SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well described in immunocompromised hosts, such as cancer patients., METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 95 patients at a major cancer center and 45 patients at a tertiary referral center. We collected clinical and radiographic data during the index hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia and measured pneumonia severity using a semi-quantitative radiographic score, the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI). Patients were evaluated in post-COVID-19 clinics at 3 and 6 months after discharge and underwent comprehensive pulmonary evaluations (symptom assessment, chest computed tomography, pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk test). The association of clinical and radiological factors with ILAs at 3 and 6 months post-discharge was measured using univariable and multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: Sixty-six (70%) patients of cancer cohort had ILAs at 3 months, of whom 39 had persistent respiratory symptoms. Twenty-four (26%) patients had persistent ILA at 6 months after hospital discharge. In adjusted models, higher peak RSI at admission was associated with ILAs at 3 (OR 1.5 per 5-point increase, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and 6 months (OR 1.3 per 5-point increase, 95% CI 1.1-1.6) post-discharge. Fibrotic ILAs (reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion) were more common at 6 months post-discharge., CONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID-19 ILAs are common in cancer patients 3 months after hospital discharge, and peak RSI and older age are strong predictors of persistent ILAs.

Immediate cause and the role of multimorbidity in deaths associated with COVID 19 among hospitalized patients in a low resource district in Kerala India: A record-based case-control analysis.,"Vaman, Raman Swathy; Valamparampil, Mathew J; Dalmita, Niya James; Reghukumar, Aravind; Anish, T S","Introduction: Multimorbidity is the coexistence of two or more chronic medical conditions in a person. The study aims to investigate the immediate cause of death and risk factors of mortality including multimorbidity among patients hospitalized with SARS CoV2 infection in Kasaragod district in Kerala, India., Methods: A record-based case-control study was done using the hospital records and follow-up surveillance system of SARS-COV 2 patients admitted in the Kasaragod district. SARS-COV 2 patients who had expired during the study period from June to December 2020 and reported as COVID-19 deaths (N = 226) were the cases, and an equal number of hospital controls were the study participants., Results: The mean (SD) age of the cases and controls were found to be 64.6 (14.2) years and 61.5 (13.4) years, respectively. Covid pneumonia alone was reported as the cause of death in more than half (52%) of the study participants. This was followed by cardiovascular events (8.5%) and acute kidney injury (6.5%). Among individual comorbidities among people who expired, diabetes mellitus (53%) was the most common, followed by hypertension (46%) and cardiovascular diseases (23%). More than 50% were found to have multimorbidity. Logistic regression showed chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.18 (1.24-3.83)) and malignancy (AOR = 3.05 (1.27-7.32)) to be significantly associated with mortality as individual determinants. Hypertension-diabetes mellitus [AOR = 1.68 (1.02-2.76), P = 0.043] and hypertension-CKD [AOR = 3.49 (1.01-12.01), P = 0.48] dyads were multimorbidities significantly associated with mortality., Conclusion: Combinations of hypertension with diabetes mellitus and CKD were found to be significant determinants for mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Uniformity in death certification is required to understand the causes and contributors to death in COVID-19.

Methods We used baseline data from an ambidirectional cohort study. We included all patients with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19 who came to the emergency room (ER) for respiratory symptoms related to COVID-19. Information regarding patients' baseline characteristics and symptoms was collected through telephone interviews and review of medical records. Vital signs were extracted from medical records as well. Results We enrolled 3,030 patients, predominantly men, with a median age of 60 (interquartile range (IQR): 44-73). Symptoms of the acute phase varied between men and women. Men presented with more respiratory symptoms, and women had general symptoms. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were common risk factors for hospital admission. Antibiotic consumption may also play a role in hospital admission. Conclusions Male sex, older age, hypertension, obesity, prior thrombotic events, and self-medicated antibiotics were associated with general hospitalization. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and cancer were associated with ICU admission. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) is a powerful tool for evaluate the impact of pre-existing health conditions on COVID-19 hospital admission. We highlight the importance of these findings as possible predictors in our region.

Predictors of Mortality in Hospitalized African American Covid-19 Cancer Patients.,"Challa, Suryanarayana Reddy; Oskrochi, Gholamreza; Chirumamilla, Lakshmi G; Shayegh, Nader; Brim, Hassan; Ashktorab, Hassan","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated outcomes manifest differently depending on patientsa TM background and pre-existing conditions. It remains unclear how African Americans with and without cancer have been affected. Aim: To determine epidemiological, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory test results to identify markers associated with mortality in COVID-19 cancer patients. Methods: We reviewed all Covid-19 hospitalized patients records from Dec. 2019 to Oct. 2021 at Howard University Hospital. Patients having a history of, or active cancer status were reviewed. All the clinical, treatment, lab values, and pathological data were extracted. Statical analysis of the Covid-19 cancer patients and comparison with non-cancer Covid-19 patients was performed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Out of 512 COVID-19 infected patients, a total of 49 patients were identified with different types of cancer, with both active and previous history. Females consisted of 26 cancer patients (53%). African American race was predominant in both cases and controls, 83.6% and 66.7% respectively. Cancer patients were older than non-cancer patients (Mean Age-70.6 vs. 56.3 years) and had an increased length of hospital stay (Mean 13.9 vs 9.4 days). Among cancer patients, breast cancer was more prevalent in females and prostate cancer in males, (54% and 52% respectively). Comparison of patients with active vs. previous cancer showed no significant difference in the clinical outcome, death vs. discharge (P=0.34). A higher reduction in albumin level in cancer cases, from the time of admission to day five, was significantly associated with death during the same hospital stay compared to those discharged (n=24, 48.9%, p<0.001). In controls, Lymphopenia (n=436, 94.1%, p=0.05), AST (n=59, 12%, p=0.008) and Albumin (n=40, 10.7%, p=0.02) have shown an association with increased mortality. Conclusion:  Albumin level has shown to have an inverse relationship with clinical outcomes among all COVID infected African American patients. Reduction in Albumin level during the hospital stay, particularly in COVID-19 cancer patients should be considered as a predictor of mortality. No significant difference was noticed in the clinical outcome in patients with previous versus active cancer.

This study investigates determinants of critical illness and in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients in Kenya. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression were employed to determine predictor factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality, respectively. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier model was used to compare the survival times using log-rank tests. As a result, 346 (19.3%) COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU, and 271 (15.1%) died. The majority of those admitted to the hospital were male, 1,137 (63.4%) and asymptomatic, 1,357 (75.7%). The most prevalent clinical features were shortness of breath, fever, and dry cough. In addition, older age, male, health status, patient on oxygen (O2), oxygen saturation levels (SPO2), headache, dry cough, comorbidities, obesity, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic lung disease (CLD), and malignancy/cancer can predicate the risk of ICU admission, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.92). Survival analysis indicated 271 (15.1%) patients died and identified older age, male, headache, shortness of breath, health status, patient on oxygen, SPO2, headache, comorbidity, CVDs, diabetes, CLD, malignancy/cancer, and smoking as risk factors for mortality (AUC-ROC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.89-0.91).

Spatial statistical analysis of pre-existing mortalities of 20 diseases with COVID-19 mortalities in the continental United States.,"Mollalo, Abolfazl; Rivera, Kiara M; Vahabi, Nasim","BACKGROUND: Although the United States is among the countries with the highest mortalities of COVID-19, inadequate geospatial studies have analyzed the disease mortalities across the nation., METHODS: In this county-level study, we investigated age-adjusted co-mortalities of 20 diseases, including cardiovascular, cancer, drug and alcohol disorder, respiratory and infectious diseases with COVID-19 over the first ten months of epidemic. One-way analysis of variance was applied to the Local Moran's I classes (High-High and Low-Low clusters, and non-significant counties of COVID-19) to examine whether the mean mortality measures of covariates that fall into the classes are significantly different. Moreover, a mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression model was employed to estimate the effects of mortalities on COVID-19 classes., RESULTS: Results showed that the distribution of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) and mortality rate co-occurrence of High-High clusters were mainly concentrated in Louisiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Also, positive associations were observed between High-High cluster of COVID-19 CFR and Asthma (OR = 4.584, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 2.583-8.137), Hepatitis (OR = 5.602, CI: 1.265-24.814) and Leukemia (OR = 2.172, CI: 1.518-3.106) mortality rates compared to the non-significant counties, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that counties with higher mortality of some cancers and respiratory diseases are more vulnerable to fall into clusters of HH COVID-19 CFR.

"Ethnicity, pre-existing comorbidities, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Santorelli, Gillian; McCooe, Michael; Sheldon, Trevor A; Wright, John; Lawton, Tom","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in thousands of deaths in the UK. Those with existing comorbidities and minority ethnic groups have been found to be at increased risk of mortality. We wished to determine if there were any differences in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day hospital mortality in a city with high levels of deprivation and a large community of people of South Asian heritage. Methods: Detailed information on 622 COVID-19-positive inpatients in Bradford and Calderdale between February-August 2020 were extracted from Electronic Health Records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between ethnicity with admission to ICU and 30-day mortality, respectively accounting for the effect of demographic and clinical confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 408 (70%) White, 142 (24%) South Asian and 32 (6%) other minority ethnic patients. Ethnic minority patients were younger, more likely to live in deprived areas, and be overweight/obese, have type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma compared to white patients, but were less likely to have cancer (South Asian patients only) and COPD. Male and obese patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU, and patients of South Asian ethnicity, older age, and those with cancer were less likely. Being male, older age, deprivation, obesity, and cancer were associated with 30-day mortality. The risk of death in South Asian patients was the same as in white patients HR 1.03 (0.58, 1.82). Conclusions: Despite South Asian patients being less likely to be admitted to ICU and having a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity, there was no difference in the risk of death compared to white patients. This contrasts with other findings and highlights the value of studies of communities which may have different ethnic, deprivation and clinical risk profiles.

Short-term mortality (up to 5 weeks post-infection) was significantly higher among COVID-19 group (1623.0/10 000) than in the reference group (118/10 000). For COVID-19 cases aged 60 years or older, increased mortality persisted until the end of the first year after infection, and was related to increased risk for cardiovascular (aHR 2.1, 95%CI 1.8-2.3), cancer (aHR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-1.9), respiratory system diseases (aHR 1.9, 95%CI 1.2-3.0), and other causes of death (aHR 1.8, 95%CI 1.4-2.2)., Interpretation: Increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to the acute illness: SARS-CoV-2 infection carries a substantially increased mortality in the following 12 months.

Impact of comorbidities on mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: An experience from Iran.,"Toofan, Firooz; Hosseini, Seyed Mojtaba; Alimohammadzadeh, Khalil; Jafari, Mehrnoosh; Bahadori, Mohammadkarim","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has spread all over the world. However, information regarding clinical characteristics and prognostic factors is scarce. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of preexistent chronic comorbid conditions and multimorbidity on risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational, single-center study. Data were analyzed from all consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who admitted in a pandemic hospital affiliated with Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, from February 20, 2020, to September 25, 2020. The independent effects of preexistent conditions were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression model., RESULTS: A total of 2597 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. At least one preexistent condition was observed in 36.5% of study population. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that older age, male sex, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney diseases, liver diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with increased risk of mortality. In addition, the number of comorbidities was significantly associated with increased odds of mortality compared to no-comorbidity., CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that patients with comorbidities have an increased risk of in-hospital mortality following COVID-19 infection.

COVID-19 in patients with and without cancer: Examining differences in patient characteristics and outcomes.,"Mohamed, Nihal E; Benn, Emma Kt; Astha, Varuna; Shah, Qainat N; Gharib, Yasmine; Kata, Holden E; Honore-Goltz, Heather; Dovey, Zachary; Kyprianou, Natasha; Tewari, Ashutosh K","This study examines differences between patients with and without cancer in patient demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 mortality and discusses the implications of these differences in relation to existing cancer disparities and COVID-19 vulnerabilities. Data was collected as a part of a retrospective study on a cohort of COVID-19 positive patients across Mount Sinai Health System from March 28, 2020 to April 26, 2020. Descriptive, comparative, and regression analyses were applied to examine differences between patients with and without cancer in demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 mortality and whether cancer status predicts COVID-19 mortality controlling for these covariates using SAS 9.4. Results showed that, of 4641 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 5.1% (N=236) had cancer. The median age of the total sample was 58 years (Q1-Q3: 41-71); 55.3% were male, 19.2% were current/former smokers, 6.1% were obese. The most commonly reported comorbidities were hypertension (22.6%) and diabetes (16.0%). Overall, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 8.3%. Examining differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer revealed significant differences (p<0.05) in COVID-19 mortality, hospitalization rates, age, gender, race, smoking status, obesity, and comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes) with cancer patients more likely to be older, male, black, obese, smokers, and with existing comorbidities. Controlling for these clinical, demographic, and behavioral characteristics, results of logistic regression analyses showed significant effects of older age and male gender on COVID-19 mortality (p<0.05). While cancer patients with COVID-19 were more likely to experience worse COVID-19 outcomes, these associations might be related to common cancer and COVID-19 vulnerability factors such as older age and gender. The coexistence of these vulnerability age and gender factors in both cancer and COVID-19 populations emphasizes the need for better understanding of their implications for cancer and COVID-19 disparities, both diseases prevention efforts, policies, and clinical management.",2021,/,Journal of cancer biology,2,1,25-32,,https://dx.doi.org/10.46439/cancerbiology.2.019,34447972,#81415,Mohamed 2021,"",James; cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); true cancer vs non-cancer
"Chronic diseases, health conditions and risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital mortality during the first wave of the epidemic in France: a cohort study of 66 million people.","Semenzato, Laura; Botton, Jeremie; Drouin, Jerome; Cuenot, Francois; Dray-Spira, Rosemary; Weill, Alain; Zureik, Mahmoud","BACKGROUND: From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, age (most importantly), male gender and various comorbidities were found to be associated with severe forms of COVID-19. However, there was little information provided for an entire country such as France, which was severely affected throughout the epidemic., METHODS: In France, the SNDS, comprising all health insurance reimbursements and benefits, and the PMSI, comprising hospital data, can be used to estimate the risk associated with about fifty diseases or health conditions for hospitalization primarily related to COVID-19 and COVID-19-related deaths. A cohort was constituted comprising all people alive on February 15, 2020. Data were censored at 15 June 2020 for COVID-19-related hospitalization and at 15 July 2020 for death for patients still hospitalized for COVID-19 on 15 June 2020. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the associations between each comorbidity (n=47) and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. These associations were determined with adjustment for age and gender, and then in models including all variables (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR])., FINDINGS: In a population of 66,050,090 people, 87,809 people (134 per 100,000) were hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020 and a subgroup of 15,661 people (24 per 100,000) died in hospital.A much higher risk was observed with increasing age, reaching a risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 more than five fold higher and a risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality more than 100-fold higher in people aged 85 years and older (absolute risks of 750 and 268 per 100,000, respectively) compared to people aged 40 to 44 years.Men were at higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization aHR 1.38 [1.36-1.40]) and COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality (aHR 2.08 [2.01-2.16]) compared to women. Positive associations between social deprivation index and risk of COVID-19 were also observed. Almost all chronic health conditions were positively associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, with the exception of dyslipidaemia, which was negatively associated. The strongest associations for both COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital mortality were observed in people with Down syndrome (7.0 [6.1-8.1] and 22.9 [17.1-30.7], respectively), mental retardation (3.8 [3.5-4.2] and 7.3 [6.1-8.8], respectively), kidney transplantation (4.6 [4.2-5.0] and 7.1 [6.0-8.4], respectively), lung transplantation (3.5 [2.4-5.3] and 6.2 [2.8-14.0], respectively) end-stage renal disease on dialysis (4.2 [3.9-4.4] and 4.7 [4.2-5.2], respectively) and active lung cancer (2.6 [2.4-2.8] and 4.0 [3.5-4.6], respectively)., INTERPRETATION: This national cohort study confirms the associations with most diseases and health conditions in France and provides data on less frequent health conditions, which could be useful particularly to target priority populations during present and future vaccination campaigns., FUNDING: None.

Factors associated with deaths due to COVID-19 versus other causes: population-based cohort analysis of UK primary care data and linked national death registrations within the OpenSAFELY platform.,"Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Bacon, Sebastian; Evans, Stephen Jw; Bates, Chris J; Rentsch, Christopher T; MacKenna, Brian; Tomlinson, Laurie; Walker, Alex J; Schultze, Anna; Morton, Caroline E; Grint, Daniel; Mehrkar, Amir; Eggo, Rosalind M; Inglesby, Peter; Douglas, Ian J; McDonald, Helen I; Cockburn, Jonathan; Williamson, Elizabeth J; Evans, David; Curtis, Helen J; Hulme, William J; Parry, John; Hester, Frank; Harper, Sam; Spiegelhalter, David; Smeeth, Liam; Goldacre, Ben","BACKGROUND: Mortality from COVID-19 shows a strong relationship with age and pre-existing medical conditions, as does mortality from other causes. We aimed to investigate how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from causes other than COVID-19., METHODS: Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged >=18 years) in the database on 1st February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration; the cut-off date for deaths was 9th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths, classified according to the presence of a COVID-19 code as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes., FINDINGS: 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for >=80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81])., INTERPRETATION: Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19., FUNDING: Wellcome, Royal Society, National Institute for Health Research, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK Medical Research Council, Health Data Research UK.

Fully adjusted logistical regression models for hospitalization, severe disease and mortality outcomes across 1-the entire cohort and 2-within self-reported race/ethnicity groups., SETTING: Three sites of the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system serving all boroughs of New York City. Data was obtained through automated data abstraction from electronic medical records., PARTICIPANTS: During the study timeframe, 110,498 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system; 11,930 patients were confirmed for COVID-19 by RT-PCR or covid-19 clinical diagnosis., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The predictors of interest were patient race/ethnicity, and covariates included demographics, comorbidities, and census tract neighborhood socio-economic status. The outcomes of interest were COVID-19 hospitalization, severe disease, and death., RESULTS: Of confirmed COVID-19 patients, 4,895 were hospitalized, 1,070 developed severe disease and 1,654 suffered COVID-19 related death. Clinical factors had stronger impacts than social determinants and several showed race-group specificities, which varied among outcomes. The most significant factors in our all-patients models included: age over 80 (OR=5.78, p= 2.29x10 -24 ) and hypertension (OR=1.89, p=1.26x10 -10 ) having the highest impact on hospitalization, while Type 2 Diabetes was associated with all three outcomes (hospitalization: OR=1.48, p=1.39x10 -04 ; severe disease: OR=1.46, p=4.47x10 -09 ; mortality: OR=1.27, p=0.001). In race-specific models, COPD increased risk of hospitalization only in Non-Hispanics (NH)-Whites (OR=2.70, p=0.009). Obesity (BMI 30+) showed race-specific risk with severe disease NH-Whites (OR=1.48, p=0.038) and NH-Blacks (OR=1.77, p=0.025). For mortality, Cancer was the only risk factor in Hispanics (OR=1.97, p=0.043), and heart failure was only a risk in NH-Asians (OR=2.62, p=0.001)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Comorbidities were more influential on COVID-19 outcomes than social determinants, suggesting clinical factors are more predictive of adverse trajectory than social factors., KEY POINTS: QUESTION: What is the impact of patient self-reported race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and clinical profile on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity, and mortality?FINDINGS: In patients diagnosed with COVID-19, being over 50 years of age, having type 2 diabetes and hypertension were the most important risk factors for hospitalization and severe outcomes regardless of patient race or socioeconomic status.

In this population-based study we aimed to identify factors associated with higher risk of COVID-19 and adverse outcome., METHODS: Data on all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the period January 1 to May 31, 2020 were extracted from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. Data on cancer and treatment was available from the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Patient Registry and the Norwegian Prescription Database. Deaths due to COVID-19 were extracted from the Cause of Death Registry. From the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry we retrieved data on admittance to hospital and intensive care. We determined rates of COVID-19 disease in cancer patients and the rest of the population. We also ran multivariate analyses adjusting for age and gender., RESULTS: A total of 8 410 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Norway during the study period, of which 547 (6.5%) were cancer patients. Overall, we found similar age adjusted rates of COVID-19 in the population with cancer as in the population without cancer. Unadjusted analysis showed that patients having undergone major surgery within the past 3 months had an increased risk of COVID-19 while we did not find increased Odds Ratio (OR) related to other oncological treatment modalities. No patients treated with stem cell or bone marrow transplant were diagnosed with COVID-19. The fatality rate of COVID-19 among cancer patients was 0.10. This was similar to non-cancer patients, when adjusting for age and sex with OR (95% CI) for death= 0.99 (0.68-1.42). Patients with distant metastases had significantly increased OR of death due to COVID-19 disease of 9.31 (95% CI 2.60-33.34). For the combined outcome death and/or admittance to hospital due to COVID-19, we found significant two-fold increased risk estimates for patients diagnosed with cancer less than one 1 year ago (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.14-3.80), for those treated with anti-cancer drugs during the past 3 months (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07-3.01) and for patients undergoing major surgery during the past 3 months (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.40-3.44).

Clinical Features and Prognostic Factors of 245 Portuguese Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19.,"Salvador, Pedro; Oliveira, Pedro; Costa, Tiago; Fidalgo, Mariana; Neto, Raul; Silva, Maria Leonor; Figueiredo, Cristovao; Afreixo, Vera; Gregorio, Tiago; Malheiro, Luis","Introduction Since the declaration of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in March 2020, Portugal was considered a role model with regards to the first COVID-19 wave. However, a third wave started in 2021 started, turning the country into the worst in the world regarding new infections and death rate per capita in the last weeks of January 2021. No significant data regarding the country's first wave of hospitalized patients have been published. Those data may help understand the differences over time regarding patients and the clinical approach to them. Herein, we present data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the main tertiary hospital of the second-most affected county at the time and identify risk factors associated with disease progression and outcomes. Materials and methods We performed a prospective observational study of patients admitted with COVID-19 to a central hospital between March 20 and June 1, 2020. The primary endpoint of this study was 30-day mortality or the need for ventilatory support and the secondary outcomes were both outcomes individually. Results 245 patients were included, with a median age of 79 years, 52% males. Hypertension (n = 172) and dyslipidemia (n = 114) were the most frequent comorbidities. Half of the patients (n = 121) were treated with hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome occurred in 114 patients; mortality at 30 days was 35%. Age (OR 1.05; 1.02-1.07) and active cancer (OR 3.89; 1.43-10.57) were associated with the primary outcome, with dyslipidemia being protective (OR 0.46; 0.25-0.80). Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir was not associated with the main outcome. Patients who had been symptomatic for more than 7 days had lower mortality (OR 0.23; 0.09-0.63). Discussion In the present study, age and cancer were associated with higher mortality, as noted in prior articles. The population had a higher median age than reported in previous studies, which may explain the increased mortality. The protective association of dyslipidemia was not previously described. This association was not related to statin intake. Conclusion The reported high mortality of COVID-19 is rarely seen in other infectious diseases. Our elderly population probably reflects more reliably the incidence of COVID-19 in European countries with constricted age pyramids.

Investigating the factors affecting the survival rate in patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study.,"Eshrati, Babak; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Erfanpoor, Saeed; Mohazzab, Arash; Moradi, Yousef","Background: As hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those who are admitted to ICU or die afterwards, generally have comorbidities, the aim of this study was to determine the factors affecting the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Iran using a retrospective cohort. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 who referred to medical centers under the supervision of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from February 22 to March 25, 2020. The final date of follow-up was April 19, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Clinical laboratory, radiological, treatment, and demographic data were collected and analyzed. The associations among gender, immune disease, diabetes, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic nervous disease, type of treatment, and risk of death were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests were used to estimate survival rate and compare survival rates, respectively. Results: The total number of deaths or desired event in the study was 329 (10.3%). The risk of death in the age groups of 50-60 years, 60-70 years, and >70 years compared to the 30-40 age group was 2.17 (95% CI: 1.03, 4.55; p: 0.040); 3.72 (95 % CI: 1.80, 7.68; p: 0.001) and 5.09 (95 % CI: 2.49, 10.40; p: 0.001), respectively. The results showed men had 11.5% more risk of deaths than women (HR: 1.11; 95 % CI: 0.89, 1.39; p: 0.341). Kidney disease increased the risk of death by 52.3% in these patients, which was not statistically significant (HR: 1.78; 95 % CI: 1.04, 3.04; p: 0.035). Also, chronic pulmonary diseases and diabetes increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients by 89.5% and 41.3% compared to COVID-19 patients without chronic pulmonary diseases and diabetes [(HR: 1.89; 95 % CI: 1.17, 3.04; p: 0.008), (HR: 1.41; 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.96; p: 0.038)]. Conclusion:  Based on the results of this study, more attention and care should be paid to COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and kidney disease to reduce the number of deaths.

We aimed to assess whether vaccine status was associated with the severity of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients., METHODS: We conducted an international, multi-centric, retrospective study in 14 centres (Bulgaria, Croatia, France, and Turkey). We collected data on patients hospitalized for >=24 hours between 1 December 2021 and 3 March 2022 with PCR-confirmed infection at a time of exclusive Omicron circulation and hospitalization related or not related to the infection. Patients who had received prophylaxis by monoclonal antibodies were excluded. Patients were considered fully vaccinated if they had received at least two injections of either mRNA and/or ChAdOx1-S or one injection of Ad26.CoV2-S vaccines., RESULTS: Among 1215 patients (median age, 73.0 years; interquartile range, 57.0-84.0; 51.3% men), 746 (61.4%) were fully vaccinated. In multivariate analysis, being vaccinated was associated with lower 28-day mortality (Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval] (OR [95CI]) = 0.50 [0.32-0.77]), intensive care unit admission (OR [95CI] = 0.40 [0.26-0.62]), and oxygen requirement (OR [95CI] = 0.34 [0.25-0.46]), independent of age and comorbidities. When co-analysing these patients with Omicron infection with 948 patients with Delta infection from a study we recently conducted, Omicron infection was associated with lower 28-day mortality (OR [95CI] = 0.53 [0.37-0.76]), intensive care unit admission (OR [95CI] = 0.19 [0.12-0.28]), and oxygen requirements (OR [95CI] = 0.50 [0.38-0.67]), independent of age, comorbidities, and vaccination status., DISCUSSION: Originally designed vaccines have remained effective on the severity of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess COVID-19-related hospitalization risk by vaccination status and age group among confirmed COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: Of the 162,509 COVID-19 cases included in the analysis, 8,546 (5.3%) required hospitalization. Among vaccinated individuals, an increased odds of hospitalization with increasing age was observed for older age groups, namely those aged 50-59 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-4.33), 60-69 years (OR = 4.82, 95% CI: 3.29, 7.07), 70-79 years (OR = 11.92, 95% CI: 8.02, 17.71), and >=80 years (OR = 24.25, 95% CI: 16.02, 36.71). However, among unvaccinated individuals, there was a graded increase in odds of hospitalization with increasing age, starting at age group 30-39 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.90, 2.41) to >=80 years (OR = 41.95, 95% CI: 35.43, 49.67). Also, comparing all the age groups to the youngest, the observed magnitude of association was much higher among unvaccinated individuals than vaccinated ones., CONCLUSION: Alongside a number of comorbidities, our findings showed a strong association between age and COVID-19-related hospitalization, regardless of vaccination status. However, age-related hospitalization risk was reduced two-fold by vaccination, highlighting the need for vaccination in reducing the risk of severe disease and subsequent COVID-19-related hospitalization across all population groups.

In response to an urgent request from the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we aimed to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death) in individuals who had completed their primary COVID-19 vaccination schedule and had received the first booster vaccine., METHODS: We constructed prospective cohorts across all four UK nations through linkages of primary care, RT-PCR testing, vaccination, hospitalisation, and mortality data on 30 million people. We included individuals who received primary vaccine doses of BNT162b2 (tozinameran; Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines in our initial analyses. We then restricted analyses to those given a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (elasomeran; Moderna) booster and had a severe COVID-19 outcome between Dec 20, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022 (when the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was dominant). We fitted time-dependent Poisson regression models and calculated adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs for the associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death. We adjusted for a range of potential covariates, including age, sex, comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stratified analyses were conducted by vaccine type. We then did pooled analyses across UK nations using fixed-effect meta-analyses., FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 28, 2022, 16 208 600 individuals completed their primary vaccine schedule and 13 836 390 individuals received a booster dose. Between Dec 20, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022, 59 510 (0.4%) of the primary vaccine group and 26 100 (0.2%) of those who received their booster had severe COVID-19 outcomes. The risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes reduced after receiving the booster (rate change: 8.8 events per 1000 person-years to 7.6 events per 1000 person-years). Older adults (>=80 years vs 18-49 years; aRR 3.60 [95% CI 3.45-3.75]), those with comorbidities (>=5 comorbidities vs none; 9.51 [9.07-9.97]), being male (male vs female; 1.23 [1.20-1.26]), and those with certain underlying health conditions-in particular, individuals receiving immunosuppressants (yes vs no; 5.80 [5.53-6.09])-and those with chronic kidney disease (stage 5 vs no; 3.71 [2.90-4.74]) remained at high risk despite the initial booster. Individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection were at reduced risk (infected >=9 months before booster dose vs no previous infection; aRR 0.41 [95% CI 0.29-0.58])., INTERPRETATION: Older people, those with multimorbidity, and those with specific underlying health conditions remain at increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and death after the initial vaccine booster and should, therefore, be prioritised for additional boosters, including novel optimised versions, and the increasing array of COVID-19 therapeutics., FUNDING: National Core Studies-Immunity, UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council), Health Data Research UK, the Scottish Government, and the University of Edinburgh.

A total of 310 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with PID or SID have now been reported in the UK. The overall mortality within the cohort was 17.7% (n = 55/310). Individuals with CVID demonstrated an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 18.3% (n = 17/93), individuals with PID receiving IgRT had an IFR of 16.3% (n = 26/159) and individuals with SID, an IFR of 27.2% (n = 25/92). Individuals with PID and SID had higher inpatient mortality and died at a younger age than the general population. Increasing age, low pre-SARS-CoV-2 infection lymphocyte count and the presence of common co-morbidities increased the risk of mortality in PID. Access to specific COVID-19 treatments in this cohort was limited: only 22.9% (n = 33/144) of patients admitted to the hospital received dexamethasone, remdesivir, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based therapeutic (e.g. REGN-COV2 or convalescent plasma) or tocilizumab as a monotherapy or in combination. Dexamethasone, remdesivir, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based therapeutics appeared efficacious in PID and SID. Compared to the general population, individuals with PID or SID are at high risk of mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increasing age, low baseline lymphocyte count, and the presence of co-morbidities are additional risk factors for poor outcome in this cohort. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Impact of vaccination on the symptoms of hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.1) infection.,"Epaulard, Olivier; Abgrall, Sophie; Lefebvre, Maeva; Faucher, Jean-Francois; Michon, Jocelyn; Frentiu, Emilia; Blanchi, Sophie; Janssen, Cecile; Charbonnier, Gabrielle; Fresse, Audrey; Laurent, Simon; Sandjakian, Lena; Casez, Pierre; Mahamat, Aba; Beraud, Guillaume","OBJECTIVES: The diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant and the waning of immune response after primary Covid-19 vaccination favoured the breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in vaccinated subjects. To assess the impact of vaccination, we determined the severity of infection in hospitalised patients according to vaccine status., METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study on patients hospitalised in 10 centres with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (Delta variant) from July to November 2021 by including all patients who had completed their primary vaccination at least 14 days before hospital admission and the same number of completely unvaccinated patients. We assessed the impact of vaccination and other risk factors through logistic regression., RESULTS: We included 955 patients (474 vaccinated and 481 unvaccinated). Vaccinated patients were significantly older (75.0 [63.25-84.0] vs. 55.0 [38.0-73.0]; p < 0.001), more frequently males (55.1% (261/474) vs. 46.4% (223/481); p = 0.009), and had more comorbidities (2.0 [1.0-3.0] vs. 1.0 [0.0-2.0]; p < 0.001). Vaccinated patients were less often admitted for Covid-19 (59.3% (281/474) vs. 75.1% (361/481); p < 0.001), had less extended lung lesions (<=25%: 64.3% (117/182) vs. 38.4% (88/229); p < 0.001), required oxygen less frequently (57.5% (229/398) vs. 73.0% (270/370); p < 0.001), at a lower flow (3.0 [0.0-8.7] vs. 6.0 [2.0-50.0] L/min, p < 0.001), and for a shorter duration (3 [0.0-8.0] vs. 6 [2.0-12.0] days, p < 0.001). , and required less frequently intensive care unit admission (16.2% (60/370) vs. 36.0% (133/369); p < 0.001) but had comparable mortality in bivariate analysis (16.7% (74/443) vs. 12.2% (53/433); p = 0.075). Multivariate logistic regression showed that vaccination significantly decreased the risk of death (0.38 [0.20-0.70](p = 0.002), ICU admission (0.31 [0.21-0.47](p < 0.001) and oxygen requirement (0.16 [0.10-0.26](p < 0.001), even among older patients or with comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalised with a delta variant SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination was associated with less severe forms, even in the presence of comorbidities.

Factors Associated With COVID-19 Death in the United States: Cohort Study.,"Chen, Uan-I; Xu, Hua; Krause, Trudy Millard; Greenberg, Raymond; Dong, Xiao; Jiang, Xiaoqian","BACKGROUND: Since the initial COVID-19 cases were identified in the United States in February 2020, the United States has experienced a high incidence of the disease. Understanding the risk factors for severe outcomes identifies the most vulnerable populations and helps in decision-making., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the factors associated with COVID-19-related deaths from a large, national, individual-level data set., METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using data from the Optum de-identified COVID-19 electronic health record (EHR) data set; 1,271,033 adult participants were observed from February 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020, until their deaths due to COVID-19, deaths due to other reasons, or the end of the study. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to evaluate the risks for each patient characteristic., RESULTS: A total of 1,271,033 participants (age: mean 52.6, SD 17.9 years; male: 507,574/1,271,033, 39.93%) were included in the study, and 3315 (0.26%) deaths were attributed to COVID-19. Factors associated with COVID-19-related death included older age (80 vs 50-59 years old: hazard ratio [HR] 13.28, 95% CI 11.46-15.39), male sex (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.57-1.80), obesity (BMI 40 vs <30 kg/m2: HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.50-1.96), race (Hispanic White, African American, Asian vs non-Hispanic White: HR 2.46, 95% CI 2.01-3.02; HR 2.27, 95% CI 2.06-2.50; HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.65-2.57), region (South, Northeast, Midwest vs West: HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.33-1.98; HR 2.50, 95% CI 2.06-3.03; HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.64), chronic respiratory disease (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.32), cardiac disease (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19), diabetes (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.75-2.10), recent diagnosis of lung cancer (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.14-2.55), severely reduced kidney function (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.69-2.19), stroke or dementia (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15-1.36), other neurological diseases (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.59-1.98), organ transplant (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.67), and other immunosuppressive conditions (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest national cohort studies in the United States; we identified several patient characteristics associated with COVID-19-related deaths, and the results can serve as the basis for policy making. The study also offered directions for future studies, including the effect of other socioeconomic factors on the increased risk for minority groups.

We enrolled two groups of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, that is, kidney transplant recipients (KTR) from the French Registry of Solid Organ Transplant (n = 306) and a single-center cohort of nontransplant patients (n = 795). An analysis was performed among subgroups matched for age and risk factors for severe COVID-19 or mortality. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission (or transfer) to an intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. Transplant recipients were younger and had more comorbidities compared to nontransplant patients. They presented with higher creatinine levels and developed more episodes of acute kidney injury. After matching, the 30-day cumulative incidence of severe COVID-19 did not differ between KTR and nontransplant patients; however, 30-day COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in KTR (17.9% vs 11.4%, respectively, p = .038). Age >60 years, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, fever, lymphopenia, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with severe COVID-19 in univariate analysis, whereas transplant status and serum creatinine levels were not. Age >60 years, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, CRP >60 mg/L, lymphopenia, kidney transplant status (HR = 1.55), and creatinine level >115 micromol/L (HR = 2.32) were associated with COVID-19-related mortality in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, and fever were associated with severe disease, whereas age >60 years, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, fever, and creatinine level>115 micromol/L retained their independent associations with mortality.

Mortality and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection: an international cohort study.,Anonymous,"BACKGROUND: The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on postoperative recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation., FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74.0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24.8%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26.1%) patients. 30-day mortality was 23.8% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51.2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38.0% (219 of 577), accounting for 81.7% (219 of 268) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1.75 [95% CI 1.28-2.40], p<0.0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2.30 [1.65-3.22], p<0.0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3-5 versus grades 1-2 (2.35 [1.57-3.53], p<0.0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1.55 [1.01-2.39], p=0.046), emergency versus elective surgery (1.67 [1.06-2.63], p=0.026), and major versus minor surgery (1.52 [1.01-2.31], p=0.047)., INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery., FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, Bowel and Cancer Research, Bowel Disease Research Foundation, Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons, British Association of Surgical Oncology, British Gynaecological Cancer Society, European Society of Coloproctology, NIHR Academy, Sarcoma UK, Vascular Society for Great Britain and Ireland, and Yorkshire Cancer Research.

Outcomes and Risk Factors of Patients With COVID-19 and Cancer (ONCORONA): A Sub-Study of the Philippine CORONA Study (preprint),"Adrian, Espiritu; Marie Charmaine, Sy; Ramon Jr Bagaporo, Larrazabal; The Philippine, Corona Study Group; Veeda Michelle, Anlacan; Roland Dominic, Jamora","Background and Objectives: A study conducted in China on patients with COVIID 19 revealed that cancer conferred a five times increased risk for needing intensive care admission and mortality. Furthermore, data from two big registry studies showed that the presence of active cancer was associated with mortality. No data was collected from the Philippines, a developing country with a different healthcare system. Thus, the investigators conducted a sub study on the participants of the Philippine COVID-19 Outcomes (CORONA) study with a history of cancer and their clinical outcomes (i.e. mortality, respiratory failure, and intensive care unit admission).Methodology: Multi-Center, Retrospective Cohort Design.Results: A total of 10, 881 patients were included in the study; out of which, 244 had a history of cancer. After adjusting to the different confounding variables of interest, having cancer was significantly associated with the following outcomes: have 75% increased odds of having severe/critical COVID-19 at nadir (CI 95% 1.32, 2.33; p &lt;0.001), have 136% increased odds of in-hospital mortality (CI 95% 1.75, 3.18; p &lt;0.001), have 109% increased odds of respiratory failure (CI 95% 1.55, 2.83; p &lt;0.001), have 98% increased odds of being admitted to ICU (CI 95% 1.47, 2.67; p &lt;0.001). Additionally, after adjusting to the different confounding variables of interest, having cancer was significantly associated with the following time-to-event outcomes: 72% increase in hazard of in-hospital mortality (CI 95% 1.37, 2.16; p &lt;0.001), 65% increase in hazard of respiratory failure (CI 95% 1.31, 2.08; p &lt;0.001), and 57% increase in hazard of being admitted to ICU (CII 95% 1.24, 1.97; p &lt;0.001).Conclusion: A history of cancer conferred poorer clinical outcomes on adult, hospitalized patients who were infected with COVID-19.

"Development of a multivariable model predicting COVID-19 mortality risk from comorbidities in an Italian cohort of 18,286 confirmed cases aged 40 years or older (preprint)","Anita, Andreano; Rossella, Murtas; Sara, Tunesi; Maria Teresa, Greco; David, Consolazio; Davide, Guido; Federico, Gervasi; Maria Elena, Gattoni; Monica, Sandrini; Antonio, Riussi; Antonio Giampiero, Russo","Background: large studies on the predictive role of chronic conditions on mortality from COVID‑19 are scarce. We developed a predictive model of death from COVID‑19 in an Italian cohort aged 40 years or older.Methods: we conducted a cohort study on prospectively collected data. The cohort included all (n=18,286) swab positive cases ≥40 year-old in patients registered with the Agency for Health Protection (AHP) of Milan up to 27/04/2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the chronic condition administrative database of the AHP. A multivariable logistic regression model, including age and gender and the selected conditions, was fitted to predict 30-day mortality risk and internally validated. External validation and recalibration were performed in a cohort of untested subjects with COVID-19 like symptoms. R software was used for the analysis.Results: chronic conditions having the largest model-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of dying within 30 days from COVID-19 infection were chronic heart failure (OR=1.9, 95%CI 1.5-2.5), tumors (OR=1.8, 95%CI 1.4-2.3), complicated diabetes (OR=1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.2) and dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (OR=1.5, 95%CI 1.0-2.2). Bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78. The model fitted on the validation cohort had a c-index of 0.93, but required recalibration. With this latter model, at a 10% risk of death threshold, 11% of the AHP population aged 40 years or older is considered at high risk.Conclusion: we identified a selected number of comorbidities predicting early risk of death in a large COVID-19 cohort aged 40 years or older.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed of the first consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time PCR assay in 127 Spanish centres until 17 March 2020. The follow-up censoring date was 17 April 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and complications data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death. RESULTS: Of the 4035 patients, male subjects accounted for 2433 (61.0%) of 3987, the median age was 70 years and 2539 (73.8%) of 3439 had one or more comorbidity. The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise and dyspnoea. During hospitalization, 1255 (31.5%) of 3979 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736 (18.5%) of 3988 were admitted to intensive care units and 619 (15.5%) of 3992 underwent mechanical ventilation. Virus- or host-targeted medications included lopinavir/ritonavir (2820/4005, 70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (2618/3995, 65.5%), interferon beta (1153/3950, 29.2%), corticosteroids (1109/3965, 28.0%) and tocilizumab (373/3951, 9.4%). Overall, 1131 (28%) of 4035 patients died. Mortality increased with age (85.6% occurring in older than 65 years). Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them including advanced age, liver cirrhosis, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Singh; George, Sokos","Objective To determine the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on patient with concomitant active cancer and CVD.Methods The researchers extracted and analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database between January 1, 2020, and July 22, 2022. They included only patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a positive test by PCR 21 days before and 5 days after the day of index hospitalization. Active cancers were defined as last cancer drug administered within 30 days of index admission. The “Cardioonc” group consisted of patients with CVD and active cancers. The cohort was divided into four groups: (1) CVD (-), (2) CVD (+), (3) Cardioonc (-), and (4) Cardioonc (+), where (-) or (+) denotes acute SARS-CoV-2 infection status. The primary outcome of the study was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including acute stroke, acute heart failure, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality. The researchers analyzed the outcomes by different phases of the pandemic and performed competing-risk analysis for other MACE components and death as a competing event.Results The study analyzed 418,306 patients, of which 74%, 10%, 15.7%, and 0.3% had CVD (-), CVD (+), Cardioonc (-), and Cardioonc (+), respectively. The Cardioonc (+) group had the highest MACE events in all four phases of the pandemic. Compared to CVD (-), the Cardioonc (+) group had an odds ratio of 1.66 for MACE. However, during the Omicron era, there was a statistically significant increased risk for MACE in the Cardioonc (+) group compared to CVD (-). Competing risk analysis showed that all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the Cardioonc (+) group and limited other MACE events from occurring. When the researchers identified specific cancer types, patients with colon cancer had higher MACE.Conclusion In conclusion, the study found that patients with both CVD and active cancer suffered relatively worse outcomes when they had acute SARS-CoV-2 infection during early and alpha surges in the United States.

Walker","Objectives To quantify in absolute and relative terms how population-level COVID-19 death rates have changed in demographic and clinical subgroups. Design Retrospective cohort study on behalf of NHS England. Setting Linked primary care and death registry data from the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, covering the first three pandemic waves in England (wave 1: March 23 to May 30, 2020; wave 2: September 7, 2020 to April 24, 2021; and wave 3, delta: May 28 to December 14, 2021). Participants In total, 18.7, 18.8, and 18.7 million adults were included for waves 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Main outcome measures COVID-19-related mortality based on linked death registry records. Results The crude rate of COVID-19-related death per 1,000 person-years decreased from 4.48 in wave 1 (95%CI 4.41;4.55), to 2.70 in wave 2 (95%CI 2.67;2.73), to 0.64 in wave 3 (95%CI 0.63;0.66). The death rate decreased by 90% between waves 1 and 3 in patients aged 80+, but by only 20% in patients aged 18-39. This higher proportional reduction in death rates was also seen for other groups, such as neurological disease, learning disability and severe mental illness. Conversely, death rates in transplant recipients stayed constant across successive waves at 10 per 1,000 person-years. There was also only a small decrease in death rates between waves in people with kidney disease, haematological malignancies or conditions associated with immunosuppression. Consequently, the relative hazard of COVID-19-related death decreased over time for some variables (e.g. age), remained similar for some (e.g. sex, ethnicity), and increased for others (e.g. transplant). Conclusions COVID-19 death rates decreased over the first three pandemic waves. An especially large decrease was seen in older age groups and people with neurological disease, learning disability or severe mental illness. Some demographic inequalities in death rates persisted over time. Groups more likely to experience impaired vaccine effectiveness did not see the same benefit in COVID-19 mortality reduction.",2022,,,,,,,10.1101/2022.07.30.22278161,84979,#125383,Collaborative 2022,Jose Chen-Xu (2023-11-02 19:21:23)(Select): ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments; haematological cancers included

PhD","Background: The epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality. Objective: Most importantly, it may assist in the implementation of efficient protective measures and public healthcare policies. Methodology: Study population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis. Results: The mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age &gt;65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.

Among women of reproductive age, in addition to age and comorbidities, pregnancy (aRR=2.69; 95%CI=1.42-5.07) was associated with increased risk of hospital admission. Interpretation Older age, male sex, substance use, intellectual and developmental disability, chronic comorbidities, and pregnancy increase the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. Funding BC Centre for Disease Control, Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Research in context Evidence before this study Factors such as older age, social inequities and chronic health conditions have been associated to severe COVID-19 illness. Most of the evidence comes from studies that don’t include all COVID-19 diagnoses in a jurisdiction), focusing on in-hospital mortality. In addition, mental illness and substance use were not evaluated in these studies. This study assessed factors associated with hospital admission among people with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia. Added value of this study In this population-based cohort study that included 56,874 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, older age, male sex, injection drug use, problematic alcohol use, intellectual and developmental disability, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, chronic comorbidities and pregnancy were associated with the risk of hospitalization. Insulin-dependent diabetes was associated with higher risk of hospitalization, especially in the subpopulation younger than 40 years. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting this finding, (insulin use and increased risk of COVID-19-related death has been described previously).

With omicron variants predominating in 2022, widespread immunity, and routine screening of asymptomatic patients in some healthcare systems, there is cause to systematically evaluate the proportion of deaths within 30 days of a positive test are COVID-19-related.Methods. Nationwide records in the Veterans Health Administration were used to identify all patients who died within 30 days after positive tests for SARS-CoV-2. Randomly-selected records of previously-vaccinated patients with positive tests in January-February, 2022, or June-August, 2022, underwent review for classification of death as caused by or contributed to by COVID-19, focused on death within 30 days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine demographic and clinical variables associated with classification of death as COVID-related, which included cause or contribution.Results. Among vaccinated patients who died within 30 days of a positive test in January-February, 2022 (omicron BA.1 predominance), death was COVID-related in 103/150 cases (69%), as the cause in 55% and contributor in 14%. In June-August, 2022 (BA.5 predominance), death was COVID-related in 70/150 cases (47%), as the cause in 22% and contributor in 25%. Variables positively associated with COVID-related death included medications for COVID-19, hypoxemia, immune-suppressive drugs, and age, whereas advanced cancer, time since positive test, and June-August time period had negative associations.Conclusions. As of mid-2022, “death within 30 days” alone no longer provided an accurate estimate of deaths from COVID-19 in a US healthcare system with routine asymptomatic screening. Over time, the proportion of cases where SARS-CoV-2 was a contributor, rather than the primary cause of death, has increased.",2023,,,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2544070/v1,84018,#128694,Jennifer 2023,"",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments
Malignancy History Affected the Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients via Release of Interleukin-6 (preprint),"Jiahao, Hu; Haixia, Ding; Shenglan, Ye; Guoxing, Xu; Xiuwen, Yang; Liangchao, Wang; Xiaowu, Shi","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a newly erupted respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has swept across the most of countries. The laboratory characteristics of COVID-patients accompanied with cancer and the risk factors for disease progression and survival of this particular population were few reported. Methods: We enrolled 585 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospitals with measured interleukin-6 level on admission. Laboratory tests and outcome were extracted from electronic medical records. Data was divided to cancer group and non-cancer group to explorer the risk factors of progression and survival.Findings: A total of 44 patients with different cancer type (cancer group) and 541 patients without cancer (non-cancer group) were included. Cancer group had significant higher levels of NEUT, NLR, IL-6, and CRP than non-cancer group, but lymphocyte count and ALB were lower. Cancer group showed significantly higher progression rate (42·1% vs 22·5%) and mortality (27·27% vs 11·91%) than non-cancer group. Elevated IL-6 and CRP were the risk factors associated with progression among moderate patients and death in-hospital (all p&lt;0·05) in non- cancer group. This correlation was not observed in caner group.Interpretation: IL-6, CRP, NEUT, and NLR were elevated in COVID-19 patients with cancer, with lower level of LYMP and ALB. IL-6 and CRP were positively correlated with progression and poor outcome in patients without cancer. As one of combined diseases, despite malignancy history did not directly affect the prognosis of COVID-19, but it could play a role in the poorer outcome through release of IL-6 and CRP.",2020,,,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-127495/v1,84064,#128722,Jiahao 2020,"",true cancer vs non-cancer

The Mortality Predictors in Patients with COVID-19 referred to the Emergency Department of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas city in 2019 (preprint),"Latife, Jabbari; Leila, AzizKhani; Saman, Shamsipour; Saeed, Hayati","Background and aim: Identifying the predictors of Mortality in COVID-19 is a way of identifying high-risk patients. Previous studies reported comorbidities and old age as the essential components of Covid-19 Mortality. The present study aims to determine the predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 referred to the emergency department.Materials and method The present descriptive-analytical study was conducted retrospectively on patients with confirmed COVID − 19 referred to the emergency department of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas in 2019. Patient information, including age, gender, underlying disease, history of smoking, clinical symptoms, type of treatment, and laboratory findings, were extracted from the covid registry.Results In this study, 2478 patients with covid 19 were examined. The average age of the study subjects was 52.57 ± 16.41 years. Among them, 1371 people (55.3%) were men. The most common clinical symptom of the patients was shortness of breath (63.2%), and the most common underlying disease was hypertension (24.3%). 16.9% of examined covid 19 patients died. According to the results of multiple logistic regression analysis, with each 1-year increase in the age of the patients, the chance of death increased by 4.7% (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, dyspnea increased the probability of death by 2.4 times, hypertension by 1.6 times, ischemic heart disease by 1.7 times, dyslipidemia by 3.6 times, stroke by 2.9 times, and malignancy by 2.2 times. (P &lt; 0.05). The most important predictor of Mortality was CRP 3+, which increased the probability of Mortality in Covid-19 patients by almost 25 times (OR = 25.338, with a 95% confidence interval in the range of 1.978 to 324.668, P = 0.013). In addition, with each unit increase in ESR, the chance of death in patients increased by 3.3% (P &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, among the clinical symptoms, anorexia (OR = 0.711, with a 95% confidence interval in the range of 0.506 to 0.999, P = 0.050) and receiving Macrolides (OR = 0.212, with a 95% confidence interval in the range 0.091 to 0.492, P &lt; 0.001) had a protective role against mortality.Conclusion Based on the results of this study, old age, dyspnea, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, dyslipidemia, stroke, malignancy, CRP 3+, and high ESR were identified as predictors of Mortality in Covid-19 patients.

Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Fatality and Severity in Patients with Coronavirus Disease in Korea: A Nationwide Population-Based Retrospective Study Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) Database,"Lee, Seung-Geun; Park, Geun U.; Moon, Yeo Rae; Sung, Kihoon","BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for fatality and severity in these patients. METHODS: In this nationwide population-based retrospective study, we investigated the data of 7339 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, aged &#8805; 18 years, using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database. Comorbidities and medications used were identified using HIRA codes, and severe COVID-19 was defined as that requiring oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilator, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The outcomes were death due to COVID-19 and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 47.1 years; 2970 (40.1%) patients were male. Lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, ribavirin, oseltamivir, and interferon were administered to 35.8%, 28.4%, 38.1%, 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.9% of patients, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, previous history of pneumonia, aging, and male were significantly associated with increased risk of death and severe disease. No medication was associated with a reduced risk of fatality and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: We found several risk factors for fatality and severity in COVID-19 patients.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (NotiWeb) of the Peruvian Ministry of Health from March 5, to October 31, 2020. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the associated comorbidities with in-hospital mortality in the different age groups according to the Peruvian Ministry of Health life stage classification: youth (18-29 years), adults (30-59 years) and older adults (≥60 years). Findings: Among, 45639 patients, 2084 youth, 21206 adults, and 22349 older adults were included. Older adults had a higher mortality rate (59.9%) compared to adults (24.7%), and youth (6.7%) (Log-rank test: p&lt;0.001). In young patients, kidney disease (OR, 7.94; 95% CI, 2.38-26.50), chronic neurological disease (OR, 10.38; 95% CI, 2.31–46.57), and cancer (OR, 16.60; 95% CI, 3.75–73.53) were associated comorbidities with in-hospital mortality. In adults, obesity (OR 1.69, 95% CI, 1.49–1.92), kidney disease (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.23–3.81), chronic neurological disease (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.05–2.66), immunodeficiencies (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.53–4.23) and cancer (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.12–4.04) were associated comorbidities. In older patients, obesity (OR, 1.47; 95% CI=1.27 - 1.71), kidney disease (OR, 1.30; 95% CI=1.08 – 1.55), chronic neurological disease (OR, 1.37; 95% CI=1.06 – 1.77), and cancer (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13–1.74), chronic lung disease (OR, 1.29; 95% CI=1.06–1.57) and liver disease (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.08–2.21) were associated comorbidities. Interpretation: Common and different associated comorbidities with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality may exist among age groups.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of asthma as a potential comorbid condition on the COVID-19 prognosis. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study included all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded on the Shiraz health department's electronic database from January to May 2020. A questionnaire was designed to collect information about patients' demographics, their history of asthma and other comorbidities, and the severity of COVID-19 by contacting them by phone. Result(s): Of 3163 COVID-19 patients, 109 (3.4%) had self-reported asthma with a mean age of 42.7 +/- 19.1 years. Most patients (98%) had mild-to-moderate asthma, while 2% had severe disease. Among asthmatic patients, fourteen (12.8%) were admitted to the hospital, and five (4.6%) died. Univariate logistic regression results showed that asthma had no significant effect on hospitalization (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.54-1.63) and mortality (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.48-2.94) in patients with COVID-19.

In an epidemic, it is necessary to explore the number of infections and deaths, identify the populations at risk, and determine the factors influencing disease death. The Retrospective cohort study used of 2110 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 data recorded in the Medical Care Monitoring Center information system from March 1, 2020, to February 7, 2021, in the city of Rafsanjan. Among a total of 2110 hospitalized patients (mean age: 56.11, SD: 19.37 years), there were 1125 (54.2%) females, 228 (10.8%) readmissions, and 318 (15.1%) deaths.

Therefore, to help predict the clinical progression of those patients with COVID-19 who have multiple comorbidities as cancer, we need various indices whose parameters we can easily measure and rapidly calculate. We evaluated several biological indicators based on inflammation and/or nutritional status, such as systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), early warning score (ANDC) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without malignancies for a prognostic significance. Methodology: This is a retrospective and observational study on 186 patients with SARS-CoV-2, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time PCR testing and hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. 75 patients had various malignancies, and the rest (111), having a similar age and comorbidity profile based on propensity score matching, had no malignancy. Results: None of the measures as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), SII, PNI or ANDC was found to be significantly different between two groups. Mortality ratio was found to be significantly higher in malignancy group (17,3%). Odds ratio for the mortality, OR:2,39 (%95 CI:1,80 -3,16) was found to be significantly higher for the malignancy group, even though the duration of hospitalization was statistically similar for both groups. PNI was found to be significantly lower for deceased patients compared with survivors in the malignancy group. Contrarily, ANDC was found to be significantly higher for deceased patients in the malignancy group. Conclusions: PNI and ANDC have independent predictive power on determining the in-hospital death in COVID-19 malignancy cases. It is suggested that ANDC seems to be a more sensitive score than SII in COVID-19 cases with malignancies.",2021,,,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-488847/v1,85340,#131660,Muge 2021,"",peer-reviewed version extracted; true cancer vs non-cancer
"Factors Associated with Mortality Among 4,227 Patients with COVID-19 in Massachusetts: A Retrospective Cohort Study (preprint)","Nicholas, Brisbon; Po-Yu, Lai; Harrison, Hubbell; John, Pyhtila; Gregg, Meyer; Dellara, Terry","Background: Originating in Wuhan, China, SARS-Cov 2 (COVID-19) has since spread across the globe. Numerous patient characteristics and co-morbidities have been associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality, though most studies have occurred outside the United States and many have utilized relatively small sample sizes. The present study investigated factors related to mortality using a large and diverse sample of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Massachusetts.Methods: Multi-site retrospective cohort study of 4,227 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a hospital and either discharged or died by July 17, 2020. Hospitalization occurred within Mass General Brigham, a healthcare system which includes two academic medical centers, community and specialty hospitals, a large physician network, and other health care entities across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data were extracted from electronic health records. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to investigate factors associated with COVID-19 mortality.Findings: 17,971 patients had tested positive for COVID-19 within the Mass General Brigham system. Of those, 4,227 (23·5%) patients had been admitted to hospital and either expired or discharged. Of the patients hospitalized, there were 3,674 (86%) who discharged and 553 (14%) who died. The mean age was 60·6 (SD = 19·1) and 53·1% were male. Of 2669 (63·1%) cases having at least one co-morbidity, 439 (16·5%) of those cases resulted in death. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors associated with mortality were age 75 years or older (odds ratio [OR] = 6·98, 95% CI: 4·13, 11·79), age 65-74 years old (OR = 3·22, 95% CI: 1·90, 5·45), male sex (OR = 1·58, 95% CI: 1·25, 2·00), blood cancer (OR = 2·00, 95% CI: 1·10, 3·63), chronic kidney disease (OR = 1·38, 95% CI: 1·05, 1·81), history of stroke (OR = 1·51, 95% CI: 1·09, 2·10), congestive heart failure (OR = 1·70, 95% CI: 1·26, 2·29), SSRI use (OR = 1·86, 95% CI: 1·15, 2·98), and BMI of 40+ (OR = 1·91, 95% CI: 1·19, 3·06). Subgroup analyses revealed COPD (OR = 1·62, 95% CI: 1·02, 2·57) as a unique risk factor for males and cardiovascular disease (OR = 2·57, 95% CI: 1·42, 4·63) and history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (OR = 2·83, 95% CI: 1·26, 6·36) for those under 65 years of age.Interpretation: Age and sex were the strongest demographic predictors of mortality. Many of the factors associated with mortality in the present study are also related to inflammation and hypercoagulability. The presence of these comorbidities and characteristics likely contribute to mortality risk, given that COVID-19 has been independently found to affect the hematologic system. It would be prudent to give special consideration to COVID-19 patients who have these characteristics or pre-existing conditions, when making decisions regarding treatment and level of care.Funding: None applicable.Declaration of Interests: None declared by all authors.Ethics Approval Statement: As the analyses were conducted for quality improvement and the report involves routinely collected and de-identified data, no ethical approval was required.",2020,,,,,,,10.2139/ssrn.3661361,84319,#132009,Nicholas 2020,Shazia  Sarela (2023-11-06 05:19:16)(Select): multivariate analysis included ; ,cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments; haematological cancers included

"Evaluation of the Effect of Underlying Diseases on Mortality of COVID-19 Patients: A Study of 19,985 Cases","Nilav, A.; Rouzbahani, A. K.; Mahmoudvand, G.; Zavari, T.","Background: The outbreak of a new coronavirus in China in 2019 (COVID-19) caused a global health crisis. Objective(s): This study was performed to investigate the effect of different underlying diseases on mortality in patients with COVID-19. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study was performed on COVID-19 patients admitted to the Shahid Rahimi and Sohada-ye Ashayer teaching hospitals in Khorramabad, Iran, from 2019 to 2021. Data on disease severity, clinical manifestations, mortality, and underlying disorders were collected and analyzed using the SPSS software version 22 at a 95% confidence interval and 0.05 sig-nificance level. Result(s): The study included 9653 men (48%) and 10332 women (52%). Patients with chronic kidney diseases, cancer, chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes were at higher mortality risk than those without these underlying diseases, respectively. However, there was no significant relationship between asthma and mortality. Also, age &gt; 50 years, male gender, oxygen saturation &lt; 93 on admission, and symptoms lasting &lt;= 5 days were associated with increased mortality. Conclusion(s): Since patients with underlying diseases are at higher mortality risk, they should precisely follow the advice provided by health authorities and receive a complete COVID-19 vaccination series.Copyright © 2022, Author(s).",2022,,Jundishapur Journal of Microbiology,15(11) (no pagination),,,,10.5812/jjm-133603,80193,#132039,Nilav 2022,"",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

L.; Senni, M.; Rambaldi, A.; Barbui, T.; Di Marco, F.","Background: In patients with pneumonia or ARDS who survived hospitalization, one-year mortality can affect up to one third of discharged patients. Therefore, significant long-term mortality after COVID-19 respiratory failure could be expected. The primary outcome of the present study was one-year all-cause mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Method(s): Observational study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital (Bergamo, Italy), during the first pandemic wave. Result(s): A total of 1326 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. Overall one-year mortality was 33.6% (N 446/1326), with the majority of deaths occurring during hospitalization (N=412, 92.4%). Thirty-four patients amongst the 914 discharged (3.7%) subsequentely died within one year. A third of these patients died for advanced cancer, while death without a cause other than COVID-19 was uncommon (8.8% of the overall post-discharge mortality). Inhospital late mortality (i.e. after 28 days of admission) interested a population with a lower age, and fewer comorbidities, more frequentely admitted in ICU. Independent predictors of post-discharge mortality were age over 65 years (HR 3.19;95% CI 1.28-7.96, p-value=0.013), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR 2.52;95% CI 1.09-5.83, p-value=0.031) or proxy of cardiovascular disease (HR 4.93;95% CI 1.45-16.75, pvalue=0.010), and presence of active cancer (HR 3.64;95% CI 1.50-8.84, p-value=0.004), but not pneumonia severity.

ObjectiveEstimate the rate and risk of severe breakthrough illness among vaccinated PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) who experience a breakthrough infection. Design, setting, and participantsThe Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET-II) collaboration consists of four US longitudinal cohorts from integrated health systems and academic centers. Adults ([≥]18 years old), in-care, fully vaccinated by June 30, 2021 with HIV, and matched PWoH (on date fully vaccinated, age group, race/ethnicity, and sex) were the source population. Those who experienced a post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were eligible. Severe COVID-19 breakthrough illness was defined as hospitalization due to COVID-19. Discrete time proportional hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals ([,]) of severe breakthrough illness by HIV status adjusting for demographics, COVID-19 vaccine type, and clinical factors. The proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or died was compared by HIV status. ExposureHIV infection OutcomeSevere COVID-19 breakthrough illness, defined as hospitalization within 28 days after a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection with a primary or secondary COVID-19 discharge diagnosis. ResultsAmong 1,241 PWH and 2,408 PWoH with breakthrough infections, the cumulative incidence of severe illness in the first 28 days was low and comparable between PWoH and PWH (7.3% vs. 6.7%, respectively, risk difference=-0.67% [-2.58%, 1.23%]). The risk of severe breakthrough illness was 59% higher in PWH with CD4 counts &lt;350 cells/mm3 compared with PWoH (aHR=1.59 [0.99, 2.46]). In multivariable analyses among PWH, being female, older, having a cancer diagnosis, and lower CD4 count increased the risk of severe breakthrough illness, while previous COVID-19 reduced the risk. Among all patients, 10% were mechanically ventilated and 8% died, with no difference by HIV status. Conclusions and RelevanceThe risk of severe COVID-19 breakthrough illness within 28 days of a breakthrough infection was low among vaccinated PWH and PWoH. However, PWH with moderate and severe immune suppression had a higher risk of severe breakthrough infection. Recommendations for additional vaccine doses and risk-reduction strategies for PWH with moderate immune suppression may be warranted.

Internationally, patient demographics and pre-existing co-morbidities are significant determinants of mortality from COVID-19. The mortality-risk in a local population is difficult to determine. The objective of our study is to examine the risk posed by epidemiological and demographic variables, and co-morbidities in our local population. Method: A retrospective, observational study was conducted on confirmed COVID-19 patients, identified from the local microbiology database. A search of the electronic patient records was performed to collect demographic details and co-morbidities. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis of the demographic variables and co-morbidities were utilised to calculate the predictive-risk for in-hospital mortality of adult COVID-19 patients. Results: Final analysis included 263 samples. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed using age as an independent categorical predictor with two cohorts - those &lt;60 and those 60 years old. Age (X2 =17.12, p&lt;0.001) was found to be an independent predictor of mortality - this was independent of sex (X2 =1.784, p&lt;0.182). Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score was found to be a significant predictor of adverse outcome. The odds of death for patients with CCI scores 0-4 was less than half (44.8%) of those with CCI scores 5 (p=0.005). Patients with no pre-existing medical conditions had a lower mortality-risk (OR=0.181, p=0.022) than those with known medical conditions. Pre-existing renal disease predicted a poor outcome (OR=1.996, p=0.027). The odds of death for the patients coming from their own-home was only 26% of the odds for those from a longterm care-home. Long-term care facility, advanced age (OR=1.058, p &lt;0.001), and long-term oral steroid (OR=3.412, p=0.016) use were all associated with a poor prognosis.

It remains unclear how African Americans with and without cancer have been affected. Aim: To determine epidemiological, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory test results to identify markers associated with mortality in COVID-19 cancer patients. Methods: : We reviewed all Covid-19 hospitalized patients records from Dec. 2019 to Oct. 2021 at Howard University Hospital. Patients having a history of, or active cancer status were reviewed. All the clinical, treatment, lab values, and pathological data were extracted. Statical analysis of the Covid-19 cancer patients and comparison with non-cancer Covid-19 patients was performed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: : Out of 512 COVID-19 infected patients, a total of 49 patients were identified with different types of cancer, with both active and previous history. Females consisted of 26 cancer patients (53%). African American race was predominant in both cases and controls, 83.6% and 66.7% respectively. Cancer patients were older than non-cancer patients (Mean Age-70.6 vs. 56.3 years) and had an increased length of hospital stay (Mean 13.9 vs 9.4 days). Among cancer patients, breast cancer was more prevalent in females and prostate cancer in males, (54% and 52% respectively). Comparison of patients with active vs. previous cancer showed no significant difference in the clinical outcome, death vs. discharge (P=0.34). A higher reduction in albumin level in cancer cases, from the time of admission to day five, was significantly associated with death during the same hospital stay compared to those discharged (n=24, 48.9%, p&lt;0.001). In controls, Lymphopenia (n=436, 94.1%, p=0.05), AST (n=59, 12%, p=0.008) and Albumin (n=40, 10.7%, p=0.02) have shown an association with increased mortality. Conclusion: Albumin level has shown to have an inverse relationship with clinical outcomes among all COVID infected African American patients. Reduction in Albumin level during the hospital stay, particularly in COVID-19 cancer patients should be considered as a predictor of mortality. No significant difference was noticed in the clinical outcome in patients with previous versus active cancer.

Mook; Richard, Pebody; Nick, Bundle","Background: Underlying conditions have been found to be associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalisation and death. This study aimed to estimate age-specific adjusted relative and absolute effects of individual underlying conditions on hospitalisation, death and in-hospital death among COVID-19 cases.Methods: We analysed case-based COVID-19 data submitted to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) between 2 June and 13 December 2020 by nine European countries. We individually assessed the association between 11 underlying conditions with hospitalisation, death and in-hospital death. Two additional categorical exposures were created: number of underlying conditions (1,2, ≥ 3) and the presence of any underlying condition (≥ 1). Adjusted ORs (aOR) for the association between each exposure condition and outcome were estimated using two multivariable logistic regression models: 1) an age-adjusted model and 2) an age-interaction model (exposure condition*age). All models were adjusted for sex, reporting period (June-September; October-December) and reporting country. From the age-interaction model we estimated the predicted probability of the three outcomes for each level of condition and age-group, marginalised over the levels of each covariable.Findings: After controlling for age, sex, reporting period and reporting country in the age-adjusted models, cases with cancer, cardiac disorder, diabetes, immune deficiency disorder, kidney disease, liver disease, lung disease, neurological disorders, obesity, any underlying condition or up to three or more conditions were between 1·5 and 5·6 times more likely to be hospitalised or die than cases with no underlying condition. Asthma was associated with increased overall risk of hospitalisation, not death. Age was an important modifier of these associations, with an age interaction present in the majority of models. For all outcomes, age-specific aOR in the age-interaction models tended to decrease with increasing age, whereas predicted probabilities of the outcome increased with age. For instance, individuals aged &lt;20 years with any underlying condition were significantly more likely to be hospitalised (aOR: 5·16, 95%CI: 4·42 - 6·02) and die (aOR: 33·77, 95%CI: 12·57 - 90·75) compared to same-aged individuals without condition. The aOR fell to 1·77 (95%CI: 1·71 - 1·83) and 1·61 (95%CI: 1·55 - 1·68) respectively in individuals 80 years and older. Conversely, the predicted probabilities of hospitalisation and death among cases aged &lt;20 years were 5·69% (95%CI: 4·97 - 6·51) and 0.15% (95%CI: 0·08 - 0·31), respectively, while they were 44·55% (95%CI: 43·68 - 45·43) and 16·31% (95%CI: 15·44 - 17·21), respectively for individuals aged 80 years and older. For some conditions, the probability of the outcome was at least as high in younger individuals with the condition as older cases without the condition.Interpretation: Several underlying conditions were found to have a significant independent effect on severe COVID-19 outcomes. Age is an important effect modifier in these associations. Interpretation of the results in this study is facilitated by considering together the estimates of relative (aOR) and absolute (predicted probabilities) effects that are presented. The presence of underlying conditions tended to have a larger relative effect in the young than the old, but the absolute probability of being hospitalised or dying increased with age. The finding that for some conditions, a younger person may have the same or even higher probability of severe outcome than an older person without it, has relevance for age and risk-factor based prioritisation of vaccination, particularly in the young.Funding Information: This study was funded through ECDC internal funding.Declaration of Interests: None to declare.",2021,,,,,,,10.2139/ssrn.3884933,84793,#135802,Tjede 2021,"",cancer as comorbidity - included due to reasonable adjustments

We aimed to use a multimorbidity index developed specifically for COVID-19 to investigate the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We used data from the UK Biobank linked to laboratory confirmed test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data from Public Health England between March 16 and July 26, 2020. By reviewing the current literature on COVID-19 we derived a multimorbidity index including: 1) angina; 2) asthma; 3) atrial fibrillation; 4) cancer; 5) chronic kidney disease; 6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 7) diabetes mellitus; 8) heart failure; 9) hypertension; 10) myocardial infarction; 11) peripheral vascular disease; 12) stroke.

Potential effect modifiers of the association were assessed: age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, body mass index, air pollution, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, cardiorespiratory fitness, high sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results Among 360,283 participants, the median age was 68 [range, 48-85] years, most were White (94.5%), and 1,706 had severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of multimorbidity was more than double in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (25%) compared to those without (11%), and clusters of several multimorbidities were more common in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common clusters with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were stroke with hypertension (79% of those with stroke had hypertension); diabetes and hypertension (72%); and chronic kidney disease and hypertension (68%). Multimorbidity was independently associated with a greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.70, 2.15] compared to no multimorbidity). The risk remained consistent across potential effect modifiers, except for greater risk among men. Conclusion The risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in individuals with multimorbidity, indicating the need to target research and resources in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and multimorbidity.",2020,,,,,,,10.1101/2020.10.21.20216721,84374,#137143,Yogini 2020,"Anushka Irodi (2023-11-05 02:29:47)(Select): Cancer as a comorbidity group (n=27287 out of n=360283) with odds ratio (adjusted for age and sex) provided in Table 4.

Lilly; Liana, K. Billings; Brian, T. Helfand; Janardan, Khandekar; Jianfeng, Xu","Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.",2020,,,,,,,10.1101/2020.07.10.20151076,84327,#137477,Zhuqing 2020,"",true cancer vs non-cancer

Data from laboratory-confirmed 188 897 COVID-19 patients diagnosed between 11 March 2020 and 22 June 2020 included in the Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Health database were analyzed retrospectively. All COVID-19 patients with hematological malignancy (n = 740) were included in the study and an age, sex, and comorbidity-matched cohort of COVID-19 patients without cancer (n = 740) at a 1:1 ratio was used for comparison. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (30.1%), myelodysplastic syndrome (19.7%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (15.7%) were the most common hematological malignancies. The rates of severe and critical disease were significantly higher in patients with hematological malignancy compared with patients without cancer (P = .001). The rates of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were higher in patients with hematological malignancy compared with the patients without cancer (P = .023, P = .001, respectively). The length of hospital stay and ICU stay was similar between groups (P = .7, P = .3, retrospectively). The rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) support was higher in patients with hematological malignancy compared with the control group (P = .001). The case fatality rate was 13.8% in patients with hematological malignancy, and it was 6.8% in the control group (P = .001).

Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. Setting 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. Participants 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19. Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital. Results The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37% (618/1658) died, and 46% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital. Conclusions ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report. In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity.

Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure Laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, complications, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Results Of 463 patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 57.5 [16.8] years), 259 (55.9%) were female, and 334 (72.1%) were African American. Most patients (435 [94.0%]) had at least 1 comorbidity, including hypertension (295 patients [63.7%]), chronic kidney disease (182 patients [39.3%]), and diabetes (178 patients [38.4%]). Common symptoms at presentation were cough (347 patients [74.9%]), fever (315 patients [68.0%]), and dyspnea (282 patients [60.9%]). Three hundred fifty-five patients (76.7%) were hospitalized; 141 (39.7%) required intensive care unit management and 114 (80.8%) of those patients required invasive mechanical ventilation.

Participants The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records. Main outcome measures Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. Results Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset.

Participants 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020. Main outcome measures Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality. Results Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of >2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI >40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI >40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of 1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level >200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level >2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone. Conclusions Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality.

In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we evaluated the characteristics and outcomes across the range of frailty in patients admitted to ICU with coronavirus disease 2019.DATA SOURCES: We contacted the corresponding authors of 16 eligible studies published between December 1, 2019, and February 28, 2021, reporting on patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICU with a documented Clinical Frailty Scale.STUDY SELECTION: Individual patient data were obtained from seven studies with documented Clinical Frailty Scale were included. We classified patients as nonfrail (Clinical Frailty Scale = 1–4) or frail (Clinical Frailty Scale = 5–8).DATA EXTRACTION: We collected patient demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale score, ICU organ supports, and clinically relevant outcomes (ICU and hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stays, and discharge destination). The primary outcome was hospital mortality.DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 2,001 patients admitted to ICU, 388 (19.4%) were frail. Increasing age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, Clinical Frailty Scale score greater than or equal to 4, use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, and hyperlactatemia were risk factors for death in a multivariable analysis. Hospital mortality was higher in patients with frailty (65.2% vs 41.8%; p < 0.001), with adjusted mortality increasing with a rising Clinical Frailty Scale score beyond 3. Younger and nonfrail patients were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation. Patients with frailty spent less time on mechanical ventilation (median days [interquartile range], 9 [5–16] vs 11 d [6–18 d]; p = 0.012) and accounted for only 12.3% of total ICU bed days.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with frailty with coronavirus disease 2019 were commonly admitted to ICU and had greater hospital mortality but spent relatively fewer days in ICU when compared with nonfrail patients.

Outcomes and inflammation changes in different types of immunocompromised patients with critically ill COVID-19 admitted to ICU: a national multicenter study.,"Li, Chunyan; ; He, Hangyong; Wang, Yuqiong; Huang, Linna; Chen, Ziying; Zhang, Qi; Cai, Ying; Zhai, Tianshu; Wu, Xiaojing; Zhan, Qingyuan","<ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Immunocompromised patients face higher risks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and co-infections, leading to a possibility of high disease severity and poor outcomes. Conversely, immunosuppression can mitigate the excessive inflammatory response induced by the virus, potentially reducing disease severity. This study aims to investigate the prognostic differences and early inflammatory response characteristics in various types of immunocompromised patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), summarize their clinical features, and explore potential mechanisms., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective analysis was conducted on critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 59 medical centers in mainland China during the Omicron outbreak from November 2022 to February 2023. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their immunosuppression status: immunocompromised and immunocompetent. Immunocompromised patients were further subdivided by etiology into cancer patients, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, and other immunocompromised groups, with immunocompetent patients serving as controls. The mortality rates, respiratory support, complications, and early inflammatory cytokine dynamics upon ICU admission among different populations were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 2030 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were included, with 242 in the immunocompromised group and 1788 in the immunocompetent group. Cancer patients had a higher median age of 69 years (IQR 59, 77), while SOT patients were generally younger and had less severe illness upon ICU admission, with a median APACHE II score of 12.0 (IQR 8.0, 20.0). Cancer patients had a twofold increased risk of death (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.18-3.46, P = 0.010) compared to immunocompetent patients. SOT and cancer patients exhibited higher C-reactive protein and serum ferritin levels than the immunocompetent group in their early days of ICU admission. The CD8<ovid:sup>+</ovid:sup> T cells dynamics were inversely correlated in cancer and SOT patients, with Interleukin-6 levels consistently lower in the SOT group compared to both immunocompetent and cancer patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU exhibit distinct clinical outcomes based on their immunosuppression status, with cancer patients facing the highest mortality rate due to variations in inflammatory responses linked to their immunosuppression mechanisms. Monitoring dynamic changes in inflammatory markers and immune cells, particularly CD8<ovid:sup>+</ovid:sup> T lymphocytes and IL-6, may offer valuable prognostic insights for these patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

COVID-19 Mortality and Severity in Cancer Patients and Cancer Survivors.,"Park, Jae-Min; ; Koo, Hye Yeon; Lee, Jae-Ryun; Lee, Hyejin; Lee, Jin Yong","<ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: We aimed to investigate mortality, severity, and risk of hospitalization in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with cancer., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Data of all patients aged 40-79 years from the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency-COVID19-National Health Insurance Service who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2022, in Korea were included. After 1:1 propensity score matching, 397,050 patients with cancer and 397,050 patients without cancer were enrolled in the main analysis. A cancer survivor was defined as a patient who had survived 5 or more years since the diagnosis of cancer. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of COVID-19 according to the diagnosis of cancer and time since diagnosis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Cancer, old age, male sex, incomplete vaccination against COVID-19, lower economic status, and a higher Charlson comorbidity index were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, hospitalization with severe state, and death. Compared to patients without cancer, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization, hospitalization with severe state, and death in patients with cancer were 1.09 (1.08-1.11), 1.17 (1.11-1.24), and 1.94 (1.84-2.05), respectively. Compared to patients without cancer, the ORs (95% CIs) for hospitalization in cancer survivors, patients with cancer diagnosed 2-5 years, 1-2 years, and < 1 year ago were 0.96 (0.94-0.98), 1.10 (1.07-1.13), 1.30 (1.25-1.34), and 1.82 (1.77-1.87), respectively; the ORs (95% CIs) for hospitalization for severe disease among these patients were 0.90 (0.85-0.97), 1.22 (1.12-1.32), 1.60 (1.43-1.79), and 2.29 (2.09-2.50), respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The risks of death, severe state, and hospitalization due to COVID-19 were higher in patients with cancer than in those without; the more recent the diagnosis, the higher the aforementioned risks.

Breast Cancer (BC) and Severe COVID-19 (C-19) Outcomes: A Matched Analysis.,"Sullivan, Marija; ; Lei, Xiudong; Giordano, Sharon H; Chavez-MacGregor, Mariana","<ovid:b>Purpose</ovid:b>: Patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (C-19) outcomes. We examine the association between breast cancer (BC), recent treatment (systemic therapy, surgery, radiation), and C-19 outcomes., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: Retrospective matched cohort study using the Optum<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup> de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset (2007-2022). Patients with C-19 were categorized into: No cancer, BC with recent treatment, and BC without recent treatment and matched based on age, C-19 diagnosis date, and comorbidity score. We evaluated 30-day mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospitalization. A composite outcome including all outcomes was analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: 2200 matched triplets (1:1:10) of patients with BC recently treated, BC not recently treated, and no cancer were included. Rates of adverse outcomes improved in 2021 compared to 2020. Compared to patients without cancer, those with BC recently treated had a similar risk of adverse outcomes, while patients with BC not recently treated had a lower risk of ICU stay and hospitalization. Using the composite variable, BC recently treated had similar outcomes (OR = 1.02; 95%CI 0.93-1.11) to patients without cancer, while BC patients not recently treated had better outcomes (OR = 0.66; 95%CI 0.59-0.74). Among patients with BC, chemotherapy within 3-months was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization (OR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.76-2.99) and composite outcome (OR = 2.11; 95%CI 1.64-2.72)., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: Patients with BC have a similar risk of adverse C-19 outcomes compared to patients without cancer.

Increased Risk of Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Patients with Colorectal Cancer: A Population-Based Propensity-Matched Analysis.,"Alsakarneh, Saqr; ; Jaber, Fouad; Qasim, Hana; Massad, Abdallah; Alzghoul, Hamza; Abboud, Yazan; Dahiya, Dushyant Singh; Bilal, Mohammad; Shaukat, Aasma","<ovid:b>Background/Objectives</ovid:b>: This study aimed to investigate the association between colorectal cancer (CRC) and the risk of breakthrough respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in vaccinated patients with CRC. <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX research network to identify vaccinated patients with CRC. Patients were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) and divided into patients with CRC and control (without history of CRC) groups. The primary outcome was the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated patients. The secondary outcome was a composite of all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and death during the follow-up period after the diagnosis of COVID-19. <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: A total of 15,416 vaccinated patients with CRC were identified and propensity matched with 15,416 vaccinated patients without CRC. Patients with CRC had a significantly increased risk for breakthrough infections compared to patients without CRC (aOR = 1.78; [95% CI: 1.47-2.15]). Patients with CRC were at increased risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections after two doses (aOR = 1.71; [95% CI: 1.42-2.06]) and three doses (aOR = 1.36; [95% CI: 1.09-1.69]) of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Vaccinated patients with CRC were at a lower risk of COVID-19 infection than unvaccinated CRC patients (aOR = 0.342; [95% CI: 0.289-0.404]). The overall composite outcome (all-cause ED visits, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause death) was 51.6% for breakthrough infections, which was greater than 44.3% for propensity score-matched patients without CRC (aOR = 1.79; [95% CI: 1.29-2.47]). <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: This cohort study showed significantly increased risks for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated patients with CRC.
