"Outcomes of the 2019 novel coronavirus in patients with or without a history of cancer: A multi-centre North London experience","N., Nalinie Joharatnam-Hogan; D., Daniel Hochhauser; K.-K., Shiu; H., Rush; V., Crolley; E., Butcher; A., Sharma; A., Muhammad; N., Vasdev; M., Anwar; G., Kantser; A., Saha; F., Raja; J., Bridgewater; , Khan K H","Background: The high prevalence and associated healthcare, social and economic challenges of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests this pandemic is likely to have a major impact on cancer management, and has been shown to potentially have worse outcomes in this cohort of vulnerable patients. This study aims to compare the outcomes of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Method(s): We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in 5 different North London hospitals (cohort A) and compared their outcomes to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients without a history of cancer (cohort B). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidty and treated during the same time period (1st March- 30th April 2020). Result(s): The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of 2 comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 (95% CI 0.4-2.5), and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4-2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68-23.95), p=0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer. Conclusion(s): Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. These data do not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts. If a second peak of pandemic strikes, a coordinated response of all overlapping specialities in the fight against cancer is required.

"Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity in patients with cancer in Wuhan, China: a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study","J., Tian; X., Yuan; J., Xiao; Q., Zhong; C., Yang; B., Liu; Y., Cai; Z., Lu; Y., Wang; S., Liu; B., Cheng; J., Wang; M., Zhang; L., Wang; S., Niu; Z., Yao; X., Deng; F., Zhou; W., Wei; Q., Li; X., Chen; W., Chen; Q., Yang; S., Wu; J., Fan; B., Shu; Z., Hu; S., Wang; X.-P., Yang; W., Liu; X., Miao; , Wang Z","Background: COVID-19 has spread globally. Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. Method(s): In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged >=18 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. Finding(s): Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13 077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22-38) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20-35) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 3.61 [95% CI 2.59-5.04]; p<0.0001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.05-6.43; p=0.039), elevated tumour necrosis factor alpha (1.22, 1.01-1.47; p=0.037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (1.65, 1.03-2.78; p=0.032), reduced CD4+ T cells (0.84, 0.71-0.98; p=0.031), and reduced albumin-globulin ratio (0.12, 0.02-0.77; p=0.024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. Interpretation(s): Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer. The risk factors identified here could be helpful for early clinical surveillance of disease progression in patients with cancer who present with COVID-19.

Method(s): We performed a multicentre, retrospective study involving 13 COVID-19 Units in Campania region from February to May 2020. We defined as severe COVID-19 presentation the cases that required mechanical ventilation and/or admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and/or in case of death. Result(s): We enrolled 371 COVID-19 patients, of whom 34 (9.2%) had a history or a diagnosis of cancer (24 solid, 6 onco-hematological). Oncologic patients were older (p<0.001), had more comorbidities (p<0.001) and showed a higher rate of severe COVID-19 presentation (p=0.001) and of death (p<0.001). Compared to 12 patients with non-active cancer and to 337 without cancer, the 17 patients with active cancer had more comorbidities and showed a higher rate of severe COVID-19 and of mortality (all p values <0.001). Compared to the 281 non-severe patients, the 90 subjects with a severe presentation of COVID-19 were older (p<0.01), with more comorbidities (p<0.001) and with a higher rate of cancer (p=0.001). At multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11) and suffering from cancer in an active stage (OR 5.33, 95% CI: 1.77-16.53) were independently associated with severe COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Since the higher risk of severe evolution of COVID-19, cancer patients, especially those with an active malignancy, should be candidates for early evaluation of symptoms and early treatment for COVID-19.© Copyright © 2021 Monari, Sagnelli, Maggi, Sangiovanni, Numis, Gentile, Masullo, Rescigno, Calabria, Megna, Gambardella, Manzillo, Russo, Esposito, Camaioni, Messina, Pisaturo, Allegorico, Pinchera, Pisapia, Catalano, Salzillo, Porta, Signoriello and Coppola.",2021,"//","Frontiers in Oncology","11","","662746-662746","","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.662746","","#64534","C 2021","James Morris (2023-10-30 02:48:54)(Select): data extraction: ensure 17 pts with inactive cancer are excluded from table 2; ","cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); true cancer vs non-cancer"
"Severity of COVID-19 in Cancer patients versus patients without Cancer: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis","C., Liu; K., Wang; L., Li; Q., Lv; Y., Liu; T., Hu; J.C., Trent; B., Sun; , Hu Q","Purpose: Data are extremely limited with regards to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Our study explored the distinct clinical features of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Experimental Design: 189 COVID-19 patients, including 16 cancer patients and 173 patients without cancer, were recruited. Propensity score 1:4 matching (PSM) was performed between cancer patients and patients without cancer based on age, gender and comorbidities. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was compared by the log-rank test. Result(s): PSM analysis yielded 16 cancer patients and 64 propensity score-matched patients without cancer. Compared to patients without cancer, cancer patients tended to have leukopenia and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin. For those with critical COVID-19, cancer patients had an inferior survival than those without cancer. Also, cancer patients with severe/critical COVID-19 tended to be male and present with low SPO2 and albumin, and high hs-CRP, lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen on admission compared to those with mild COVID-19. In terms of risk factors, recent cancer diagnosis (within 1 year of onset of COVID-19) and anti-Tumor treatment within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Conclusion(s): We found COVID-19 patients with cancer have distinct clinical features as compared to patients without cancer. Importantly, cancer patients with critical COVID-19 were found to have poorer outcomes compared to those without cancer. In the cancer cohort, patients with severe/critical COVID-19 presented with a distinct clinical profile from those with mild COVID-19; short cancer history and recent anti-cancer treatment were associated with inferior survival.Copyright © 2021 Ivyspring International Publisher.

"Systemic anti-cancer therapy and metastatic cancer are independent mortality risk factors during two uk waves of the covid-19 pandemic at university college london hospital","Y.N.S., Wong; C.C.T., Sng; D., Ottaviani; G., Patel; A., Chowdhury; I., Earnshaw; A., Sinclair; E., Merry; A., Wu; M., Galazi; S., Benafif; G., Soosaipillai; N., Chopra; R., Roylance; H., Shaw; , Lee A J X","An increased mortality risk was observed in patients with cancer during the first wave of COVID-19. Here, we describe determinants of mortality in patients with solid cancer comparing the first and second waves of COVID-19. A retrospective analysis encompassing two waves of COVID-19 (March-May 2020; December 2020-February 2021) was performed. 207 patients with cancer were matched to 452 patients without cancer. Patient demographics and oncological variables such as cancer subtype, staging and anti-cancer treatment were evaluated for association with COVID-19 mortality. Overall mortality was lower in wave two compared to wave one, HR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.30-0.56). In patients with cancer, mortality was 43.6% in wave one and 15.9% in wave two. In hospitalized patients, after adjusting for age, ethnicity and co-morbidities, a history of cancer was associated with increased mortality in wave one but not wave two. In summary, the second UK wave of COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients. A history of solid cancer was not associated with increased mortality despite the dominance of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. In both waves, metastatic disease and systemic anti-cancer treatment appeared to be independent risk factors for death within the combined cancer cohort.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

"Immunological alternation in COVID-19 patients with cancer and its implications on mortality","G., Cai; Y., Gao; S., Zeng; Y., Yu; X., Liu; D., Liu; Y., Wang; R., Yu; A., Desai; C., Li; Gao Q.  AO  - Cai, Guangyao; ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0943-0106","Patients with malignancy were reportedly more susceptible and vulnerable to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and witnessed a greater mortality risk in COVID-19 infection than noncancerous patients. But the role of immune dysregulation of malignant patients on poor prognosis of COVID-19 has remained insufficiently investigated. Here we conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 2,052 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Cancer, n = 93; Non-cancer, n = 1,959), and compared the immunological characteristics of both cohorts. We used stratification analysis, multivariate regressions, and propensity-score matching to evaluate the effect of immunological indices. In result, COVID-19 patients with cancer had ongoing and significantly elevated inflammatory factors and cytokines (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8), as well as decreased immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, Th and Ts cells) than those without cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cancer cohort (24.7%) than non-cancer cohort (10.8%). By stratification analysis, COVID-19 patients with immune dysregulation had poorer prognosis than those with the relatively normal immune system both in cancer and non-cancer cohort. By logistic regression, Cox regression, and propensity-score matching, we found that prior to adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was associated with an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 (p < .05); after adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was no longer an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19 (p > .30). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with cancer had more severely dysregulated immune responses than noncancerous patients, which might account for their poorer prognosis.

METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a multi-hospital, academic medical institution in New York City. Outcomes included mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and AKI among hospitalized patients. We also evaluated risk of hospitalization among all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multilevel logistic regression models were used for analysis. RESULT(S): We identified 6,893 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 4,018 were hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients 374 (9%) had a history of cancer, 281 (7%) experienced AKI, and 1,045 (26%) died. In adjusted analyses, patients with a history of cancer had 1.33 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.69) times the odds of death compared to those without cancer and this appeared to be driven by lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.44, 95% CI= 1.05, 4.39). Patients with a history of genitourinary cancer were not at higher risk of mortality compared to those without cancer (OR=0.99, 95% CI= 0.61, 1.62). History of cancer was not associated with ICU admission or AKI in overall and subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with a history of cancer who are hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not at greater risk for AKI, though they are at higher risk for mortality as compared to patients without a history of cancer. The increased risk in mortality appears driven by patients with pulmonary neoplasms. Patients with a history of genitourinary malignancies do not appear to be at higher risk for AKI or for mortality compared to the general population.",2021,"//","Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP","22","2","517-522","","https://dx.doi.org/10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.2.517","","#66232","J 2021","James Morris (2023-10-28 21:03:05)(Select): all cause mortality but ICU admission relevant - gives ORs for 6 cancer types vs non cancer and all cancer vs non cancer; Fazal Shah (2023-10-10 21:35:38)(Select): Table 2 has ORs for cancer vs no cancer: mortality, ICU; ","cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed for now); true cancer vs non-cancer"
"Evaluation of COVID-19 Mortality and Adverse Outcomes in US Patients with or Without Cancer","M., Chavez-Macgregor; X., Lei; H., Zhao; P., Scheet; , Giordano S H","Importance: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, understanding the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19 has become critically important. Objective(s): To compare the outcomes of patients with or without cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospitalization. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study obtained data from the Optum de-identified COVID-19 electronic health record data set. More than 500000 US adults who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were analyzed. Exposures: The patient groups were (1) patients without cancer, (2) patients with no recent cancer treatment, and (3) patients with recent cancer treatment (within 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis) consisting of radiation therapy or systemic therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were the main outcomes. Unadjusted rates and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of adverse outcomes were presented according to exposure group. Result(s): A total of 507307 patients with COVID-19 were identified (mean [SD] age, 48.4 [18.4] years; 281 165 women [55.4%]), of whom 493020 (97.2%) did not have cancer. Among the 14287 (2.8%) patients with cancer, 9991 (69.9%) did not receive recent treatment and 4296 (30.1%) received recent treatment. In unadjusted analyses, patients with cancer, regardless of recent treatment received, were more likely to have adverse outcomes compared with patients without cancer (eg, mortality rate: 1.6% for patients without cancer, 5.0% for patients with no recent cancer treatment, and 7.8% for patients with recent cancer treatment). After adjustment, patients with no recent cancer treatment had similar or better outcomes than patients without cancer (eg, mortality OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.84-1.02]; mechanical ventilation OR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.54-0.68]). In contrast, a higher risk of death (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.54-1.96), ICU stay (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.54-1.87), and hospitalization (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27) was observed in patients with recent cancer treatment. Compared with patients with nonmetastatic solid tumors, those with metastatic solid tumors and hematologic malignant neoplasms had worse outcomes (eg, mortality OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.96-2.84]; mechanical ventilation OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.70-1.08]). Recent chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy were also associated with worse outcomes (eg, chemotherapy mortality OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.51-2.26]). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that patients with recent cancer treatment and COVID-19 had a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes, and patients with no recent cancer treatment had similar outcomes to those without cancer.

Patients with hematological malignancies are particularly at risk of an unfavorable course of COVID-19. The endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) score has been used as a simple predictor of overall survival (OS) in specific groups of hematological cancer patients. EASIX, as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, might play a prognostic role in patients with COVID-19. Here, we performed a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the EASIX score in 523 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without coexisting hematological cancer. Hematological cancer COVID-19 patients had higher EASIX scores compared to the overall population with COVID-19. In hematological patients, EASIX was a strong predictor of the occurrence of sepsis during COVID-19. Our findings demonstrated EASIX as a strong predictor of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital mortality, the occurrence of acute renal failure and the need for hemodialysis, both in hematological and non-hematological COVID-19 patients. Patients with a high EASIX score on COVID-19 diagnosis had significantly inferior OS compared to patients with low EASIX.

Result(s): We evaluated 388 COVID-19 patients with thyroid cancer [median age: 54 years, interquartile range (IQR) 18 years, males: 23%] and age and gender-matched 388 COVID-19 patients without thyroid cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer had a similar mortality ratio compared with the non-cancer group. Among patients with thyroid cancer, age, presence of diabetes mellitus, asthma/COPD, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, prior coronary artery disease, RAS blocker usage and low lymphocyte count were associated with mortality. Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment and cumulative radioactive iodine dosage did not negatively affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease in our patient group. Conclusion(s): Our study indicated that history of thyroid cancer did not have an increased risk of mortality or morbidity in COVID-19 disease. Besides, RAI therapy history and doses of radioactive iodine did not affect mortality or outcome.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,"//","Clinical Endocrinology","95","4","628-637","","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cen.14486","","#69975","Sahin 2021","","cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); true cancer vs non-cancer"

However, little is known about the risk factors of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without cancer in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without cancer and to compare mortality according to gender and topography during the year 2020 in Brazil. Method(s): This was a secondary data study of hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing in Brazil. The data were collected from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System. Result(s): This study analyzed data from 322,817 patients. The prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.3%. COVID-19 patients with neurological diseases and cancer had the most lethal comorbidities in both sexes. COVID-19 patients with cancer were more likely to be older (median age, 67 vs 62 years; P <.001), to have a longer hospital stay (13.1 vs 11.5 days; P <.001), to be admitted to the intensive care unit (45.3% vs 39.6%; P <.001), to receive more invasive mechanical ventilation (27.1% vs 21.9%), and to have a higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-2.06; P <.001) than those without cancer. Patients with hematological neoplasia (aOR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.41-3.38; P <.001) had a higher risk of mortality than those with solid tumors (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.72-1.95; P <.001) in both sexes. Conclusion(s): Brazilian COVID-19 patients with cancer have higher disease severity and a higher risk of mortality than those without cancer.Copyright © 2021 American Cancer Society",2021,"//","Cancer","127","22","4240-4248","","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33832","","#69989","Costa 2021","Anita Patel (2023-11-01 23:11:53)(Select): table 2 p.4 outcomes by cancer and non-cancer pt

We investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We identified patients with a history of cancer admitted to two large hospitals between March 13, 2020, and May 10, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched them 1:2 to patients without a history of cancer. Result(s): Men made up 56.2% of the population, with a median age of 69 years (range, 30-96). The median time since cancer diagnosis was 35.6 months (range, 0.39-435); 80% had a solid tumor, and 20% had a hematologic malignancy. Among patients with cancer, 27.8% died or entered hospice versus 25.6% among patients without cancer. In multivariable analyses, the odds of death/hospice were similar (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.82). The odds of intubation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.78), shock (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91), and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81) were lower for patients with a history of cancer versus controls. Patients with active cancer or who had received cancer-directed therapy in the past 6 months had similar odds of death/hospice compared with cancer survivors (univariable OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.66-2.60; multivariable OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.69-3.16). Conclusion(s): Patients with a history of cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 had similar mortality to matched hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without cancer, and a lower risk of complications. In this population, patients with active cancer or recent cancer treatment had a similar risk for adverse outcomes compared with survivors of cancer. Implications for Practice: This study investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death or hospice admission in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Active cancer, systemic cancer therapy, and a cancer history are not independent risk factors for death from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, and hospitalized patients without cancer are more likely to have severe COVID-19. These findings provide reassurance to survivors of cancer and patients with cancer as to their relative risk of severe COVID-19, may encourage oncologists to provide standard anticancer therapy in patients at risk of COVID-19, and guide triage in future waves of infection.Copyright © 2021 AlphaMed Press.",2021,"//","Oncologist","26","8","685-693","","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/onco.13794","","#70019","Klein 2021","Long Hei Fong (2023-12-01 21:18:10)(Included): Primary outcome is defined as ""mortality OR admission to hospice.

Method(s): We analysed 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and haematological malignancies. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared to a matched control group of 53 non-cancer patients with COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with poor outcome. Result(s): The most frequent haematological diseases were lymphoma (30%) and multiple myeloma (30%). Eighty-seven % HP developed moderate or severe disease. Patients with haematological malignancies had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (35.9% vs 13.2%; P =.003 (odds ratio 6.652). The worst outcome was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. Only age >70 years and C reactive protein >10 mg/dl at admission were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio 34.86, P =.003 and 13.56,P =.03). Persistent viral sheddind was detected in 5 HP. Active chemotherapy, viral load at diagnosis and COVID-19 therapy were not predictors of outcome. Conclusion(s): Mortality of COVID-19 is significantly higher in patients with haematological malignancies compared to non-cancer patients. The impact of persistent viral shedding must be considered in order to re-start therapies and maintain infectious control measures.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Early COVID-19 Hospitalizations Among New York State Residents with a History of Invasive Cancer.","Zhang, Xiuling; Gates Kuliszewski, Margaret; Kahn, Amy R; Schymura, Maria J","Background: Individuals with a history of cancer may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 due to immunosuppression, comorbidities, or ongoing treatment. We linked inpatient claims data on COVID-19 hospitalizations to cancer diagnoses from the New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR) to examine associations between prior cancer diagnoses and hospitalizations for COVID-19, and factors associated with death at discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization., Methods: New York State (NYS) residents diagnosed with invasive cancer before July 1, 2021, who were alive on January 1, 2020, were identified from NYSCR data. We obtained claims data for discharge year 2020 and the first half of 2021 from NYS's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), and we linked inpatient records with COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis to cancer data from the NYSCR using deterministic matching methods. We calculated descriptive statistics and conducted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses to examine associations of cancer case characteristics with COVID-19 hospitalization and with vital status at discharge among patients with a history of cancer. All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4., Results: Our analysis included 1,257,377 individuals with a history of cancer, 10,210 of whom had a subsequent primary COVID-19 hospitalization. Individuals with a history of cancer were 16% more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to the general population of NYS, after adjusting for age and sex (95% CI, 14%-19%). Factors independently associated with COVID-19 hospitalization among cancer patients included older age, male sex, non-Hispanic Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, diagnosis with late-stage cancer or with multiple tumors, more recent cancer diagnosis, and New York City (NYC) residency at the time of cancer diagnosis. Factors independently associated with death at discharge among individuals with COVID-19 hospitalization and a prior cancer diagnosis included older age, male sex, non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander race or Hispanic ethnicity, residence in NYC at the time of COVID-19 hospitalization, and an active cancer diagnosis claim code at the time of COVID-19 hospitalization., Conclusion: This claims-based study identified higher risks of COVID-19 hospitalization and death at discharge among individuals with a history of cancer, and particularly those in certain demographic and diagnostic groups.

Of these, 52,019 tested positive for COVID-19 of whom 13,752 had a cancer diagnosis. We conducted Firth-corrected logistic regression to assess the association between cancer status, site, treatment, vaccination, and four COVID-19 outcomes: hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mortality, and a composite ""severe COVID"" outcome., RESULTS: Cancer diagnosis was significantly associated with higher rates of severe COVID, hospitalization, and mortality. These associations were driven by patients whose most recent initial cancer diagnosis was within the past 3 years. Chemotherapy receipt, colorectal cancer, hematologic malignancies, kidney cancer, and lung cancer were significantly associated with higher rates of worse COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccinations were significantly associated with lower rates of worse COVID-19 outcomes regardless of cancer status., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with colorectal cancer, hematologic malignancies, kidney cancer, or lung cancer or who receive chemotherapy for treatment should be cautious because of their increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes, even after vaccination., IMPACT: Additional COVID-19 precautions are warranted for people with certain cancer types and treatments. Significant benefit from vaccination is noted for both cancer and cancer-free patients.

We conducted this retrospective study in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to find differences in inflammatory markers and mortality in cancer patients compared to others., METHODS: We reviewed the electronic records of patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR from March to September 2020. Data on socio-demographics, comorbidities, inflammatory makers, and cancer-related features were analyzed., RESULTS: 2,772 patients were admitted for SARS-CoV-2, to the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal in Madrid during this period. Of these, 2,527 (91%) had no history of neoplastic disease, 164 (5.9%) patients had a prior history of cancer but were not undergoing oncological treatment at the time of infection, and 81 (2.9%) were in active treatment. Mortality in patients without a history of cancer was 19.5%, 28.6% for patients with a prior history of cancer, and 34% in patients with active cancer treatment. Patients in active oncology treatment with the highest mortality rate were those diagnosed with lung cancer (OR 5.6 95% CI: 2.2-14.1). In the multivariate study, active oncological treatment (OR 2.259 95% CI: 1.35-3.77) and chemotherapy treatment (OR 3.624 95% CI: 1.17-11.17), were statistically significant factors for the risk of death for the whole group and for the group with active oncological treatment, respectively., CONCLUSION: Cancer patients on active systemic treatment have an increased risk of mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially with lung cancer or chemotherapy treatment.

Among the booming literatures about COVID-19, there is yet a paucity of study addressing the association between COVID-19 and cancer, which is a rare comorbidity of COVID-19, as well as consensus for treatment of cancer in this pandemic. Method(s): In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, information of all inpatient cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had treatment outcome were collected from the designated departments in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China on March 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Severe events were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Result(s): A total of 716 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified. Among them, a total of 12 cases (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.7%-2.6%) had history of cancer with 4 cases (33%) experienced severe events. Compared with cases without cancer, patients with cancer have higher risks of severe events (33% vs 7.7%, p=0.012) and deaths (25% vs 3.6%, p=0.009). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that cancer was independently associated with increased odds of severe events after adjusting for other risk factors (OR 6.51, 95% CI 1.72-24.64; p=0.006). Among COVID-19 patients with cancer, we found that patients older than 60 years (75%), with other comorbidities (50%), or experiencing anticancer treatment in past month (42.9%) had a numerically higher incidence of severe events. Conclusion(s): Cancer is a rare comorbidity of patients with COVID-19; however, it cannot be overemphasized due to its poorer outcomes. We propose that personalized treatment recommendation for cancer patients should be addressed during COVID-19 pandemic, along with meticulous personal protective protocols for them to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright Â© 2020 Ivyspring International Publisher.

Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, health care exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled in a population-based study before the pandemic (n=67 cancer patients; n=256 noncancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.12 to 4.18) and 30-day mortality (odds ratio = 5.67, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 21.59).

Covid-19 patients with and without cancer referred to Amir Al-Momenin, and Khansari Hospital in Arak city from June 2020 to July 2021 were included. The data were organized into demographics, underlying medical conditions, ICU admission, and imaging findings. Result(s): Overall, 323 Covid-19 patients were included in the analysis, and 109 cases of them were cancer patients. The mean age was 63.12+/-15.38 years, and 53.87% were female. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate (41.28% vs 41.28%12.62%) was significantly higher in the cancer group than in the control group (P<0.001). The involvement of lung lobes in the cancer group was higher than in the control group (P=0.011) (70.56% in the left lung and 71.1% in the right lung of cancer patients than 77.40% in the left lung and 83.10% in the right lung).

This difference in the right upper lobe (RUL) lob was significant (P=0.011) and consolidation (CON) was higher in CT images of the control group, but the differences were not significant (P>0.05). The mean total score in the cancer group was 6.23+/-2.76 and in the control group was 5.87+/-2.23 (P=0.202). The mean score in the cancer group of left lower lobe (LLL) lung lobes was 1.46+/-0.94 and in the control group was 1.21+/-0.76 (P=0.010) (Table 2). Conclusion(s): The results showed that GGO and consolidation were common findings in CT images. GGO was higher in cancer patients. The involvement of lung lobes in the cancer group was higher than in the control group. ICU admission rate was significantly higher in cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s)",2022,"","Trauma Monthly","","","","","https://dx.doi.org/10.30491/TM.2022.316343.1403","","#72901","M 2022","Abigail Burn (2023-10-27 19:47:41)(Select): 109 cancer patients, 214 non-cancer patients

Method(s): Retrospective, case-control (1:3) study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Cases were patients with haematological malignancies and COVID-19, controls had COVID-19 without haematological malignancies. Patients were matched for sex, age and time of hospitalization. Result(s): Overall, 66 cases and 198 controls were included in the study. Cases had higher prior corticosteroid use, infection rates, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and more likely received corticosteroids and antibiotics than controls. Cases had higher respiratory deterioration than controls (78.7% vs 65.5%, p = 0.04). Notably, 29% of cases developed respiratory worsening > 10 days after hospital admission, compared to only 5% in controls. Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality were higher in cases than in controls (27% vs 8%, p = 0.002, and 35% vs 10%, p < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, having haematological malignancy [OR4.76, p < 0.001], chronic corticosteroid therapy [OR3.65, p = 0.004], prior infections [OR57.7, p = 0.006], thrombocytopenia [OR3.03, p < 0.001] and neutropenia [OR31.1, p = 0.001], low albumin levels [OR3.1, p = 0.001] and >= 10 days from hospital admission to respiratory worsening [OR3.3, p = 0.002] were independently associated with mortality. In cases, neutropenia [OR3.1, p < 0.001], prior infections [OR7.7, p < 0.001], >= 10 days to respiratory worsening [OR4.1, p < 0.001], multiple myeloma [OR1.5, p = 0.044], the variation of the CT lung score during hospitalization [OR2.6, p = 0.006] and active treatment [OR 4.4, p < 0.001] all were associated with a worse outcome. Conclusion(s): An underlying haematological malignancy was associated with a worse clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. A prolonged clinical monitoring is needed, since respiratory worsening may occur later during hospitalization.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).",2022,"","Infection","","","","","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15010-022-01869-w","","#72961","O 2022","","cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); subsets in cancer diagnosis recency; true cancer vs non-cancer"

"Mortality Rate and Effects of COVID-19 in Cancer Patients versus Non-cancer Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Study","Ghadamgahi F.; Safari M.; Faradmal J.; Bashirian S.; Soltanian A.R.; Khazaei S.; Roshanaei G. ","Background and Aim: Coronavirus is still a life-threatening disease around the world. In patients with this disease, having an underlying disease reduces the effectiveness of treatment and increases mortality. This study aimed to examine the effect of cancer history on mortality rates in patients with COVID-19. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was a case-control study involving 60 cancer patients with COVID-19 as the case group and 180 non-cancer patients with COVID-19 as the control group. A matching method based on propensity score was used to select patients in the control group. The effect of treatment on the outcome (recovery death) was studied with logistic regression, and the factors affecting patient survival were analyzed with Cox models. R software was used to analyze the data. Result(s): The mean (SD) age of patients in the case and control groups was 61.37 (13.47) and 63.19 (13.95) years, respectively. In the case group, 37 patients (61.7%), and in the control group, 114 patients (63.3%) were male. 23 cancer patients (38.3%) and 26 non-cancer patients (14.4%) died. The results of logistic regression as well as the Cox model showed the variables of age, blood oxygen level (SpO2), admission to the intensive care unit, and cancer history as significant for patient death (P <0.05). Conclusion(s): To study the effect of demographic, clinical, and laboratory results on the risk of death among COVID-19 patients with and without a cancer history, control group in this study was selected by PSM method. The results of this study have indicated cancer history to be one of the factors affecting the mortality of patients with COVID-19 in addition to age variables, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).Copyright © 2023 Ghadamgahi et al.",2023,"/","Open Public Health Journal","16","(Ghadamgahi) Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran, Islamic Republic of(Safari) Department of Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran, Islamic","e187494452305260","2024752659","https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/18749445-v16-230621-2022-153","","#73818","Ghadamgahi 2023","","cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed for now); true cancer vs non-cancer"
"Predictors of Mortality in Hospitalized African American Covid-19 Cancer Patients.","Challa, Suryanarayana Reddy; Oskrochi, Gholamreza; Chirumamilla, Lakshmi G; Shayegh, Nader; Brim, Hassan; Ashktorab, Hassan","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated outcomes manifest differently depending on patientsa TM background and pre-existing conditions. It remains unclear how African Americans with and without cancer have been affected. Aim: To determine epidemiological, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory test results to identify markers associated with mortality in COVID-19 cancer patients. Methods: We reviewed all Covid-19 hospitalized patients records from Dec. 2019 to Oct. 2021 at Howard University Hospital. Patients having a history of, or active cancer status were reviewed. All the clinical, treatment, lab values, and pathological data were extracted. Statical analysis of the Covid-19 cancer patients and comparison with non-cancer Covid-19 patients was performed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Out of 512 COVID-19 infected patients, a total of 49 patients were identified with different types of cancer, with both active and previous history. Females consisted of 26 cancer patients (53%). African American race was predominant in both cases and controls, 83.6% and 66.7% respectively. Cancer patients were older than non-cancer patients (Mean Age-70.6 vs. 56.3 years) and had an increased length of hospital stay (Mean 13.9 vs 9.4 days). Among cancer patients, breast cancer was more prevalent in females and prostate cancer in males, (54% and 52% respectively). Comparison of patients with active vs. previous cancer showed no significant difference in the clinical outcome, death vs. discharge (P=0.34). A higher reduction in albumin level in cancer cases, from the time of admission to day five, was significantly associated with death during the same hospital stay compared to those discharged (n=24, 48.9%, p<0.001). In controls, Lymphopenia (n=436, 94.1%, p=0.05), AST (n=59, 12%, p=0.008) and Albumin (n=40, 10.7%, p=0.02) have shown an association with increased mortality. Conclusion:  Albumin level has shown to have an inverse relationship with clinical outcomes among all COVID infected African American patients. Reduction in Albumin level during the hospital stay, particularly in COVID-19 cancer patients should be considered as a predictor of mortality. No significant difference was noticed in the clinical outcome in patients with previous versus active cancer. Further research with a large cohort size is needed to verify and identify other predictors of outcome in Covid-19 cancer patients and develop appropriate treatment modalities.",2022,"/","Research square","","101768035","","","https://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1363151/v1","35350203","#80197","Challa 2022","","cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed for now); true cancer vs non-cancer"

Data was collected as a part of a retrospective study on a cohort of COVID-19 positive patients across Mount Sinai Health System from March 28, 2020 to April 26, 2020. Descriptive, comparative, and regression analyses were applied to examine differences between patients with and without cancer in demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 mortality and whether cancer status predicts COVID-19 mortality controlling for these covariates using SAS 9.4. Results showed that, of 4641 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 5.1% (N=236) had cancer. The median age of the total sample was 58 years (Q1-Q3: 41-71); 55.3% were male, 19.2% were current/former smokers, 6.1% were obese. The most commonly reported comorbidities were hypertension (22.6%) and diabetes (16.0%). Overall, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 8.3%. Examining differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer revealed significant differences (p<0.05) in COVID-19 mortality, hospitalization rates, age, gender, race, smoking status, obesity, and comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes) with cancer patients more likely to be older, male, black, obese, smokers, and with existing comorbidities. Controlling for these clinical, demographic, and behavioral characteristics, results of logistic regression analyses showed significant effects of older age and male gender on COVID-19 mortality (p<0.05). While cancer patients with COVID-19 were more likely to experience worse COVID-19 outcomes, these associations might be related to common cancer and COVID-19 vulnerability factors such as older age and gender. The coexistence of these vulnerability age and gender factors in both cancer and COVID-19 populations emphasizes the need for better understanding of their implications for cancer and COVID-19 disparities, both diseases prevention efforts, policies, and clinical management.",2021,"/","Journal of cancer biology","2","1","25-32","","https://dx.doi.org/10.46439/cancerbiology.2.019","34447972","#81415","Mohamed 2021","","James; cancer diagnosis time unknown (do not proceed); true cancer vs non-cancer"
"Outcomes and Risk Factors of Patients With COVID-19 and Cancer (ONCORONA): A Sub-Study of the Philippine CORONA Study (preprint)","Adrian, Espiritu; Marie Charmaine, Sy; Ramon Jr Bagaporo, Larrazabal; The Philippine, Corona Study Group; Veeda Michelle, Anlacan; Roland Dominic, Jamora","Background and Objectives: A study conducted in China on patients with COVIID 19 revealed that cancer conferred a five times increased risk for needing intensive care admission and mortality. Furthermore, data from two big registry studies showed that the presence of active cancer was associated with mortality. No data was collected from the Philippines, a developing country with a different healthcare system. Thus, the investigators conducted a sub study on the participants of the Philippine COVID-19 Outcomes (CORONA) study with a history of cancer and their clinical outcomes (i.e. mortality, respiratory failure, and intensive care unit admission).Methodology: Multi-Center, Retrospective Cohort Design.Results: A total of 10, 881 patients were included in the study; out of which, 244 had a history of cancer. After adjusting to the different confounding variables of interest, having cancer was significantly associated with the following outcomes: have 75% increased odds of having severe/critical COVID-19 at nadir (CI 95% 1.32, 2.33; p &lt;0.001), have 136% increased odds of in-hospital mortality (CI 95% 1.75, 3.18; p &lt;0.001), have 109% increased odds of respiratory failure (CI 95% 1.55, 2.83; p &lt;0.001), have 98% increased odds of being admitted to ICU (CI 95% 1.47, 2.67; p &lt;0.001). Additionally, after adjusting to the different confounding variables of interest, having cancer was significantly associated with the following time-to-event outcomes: 72% increase in hazard of in-hospital mortality (CI 95% 1.37, 2.16; p &lt;0.001), 65% increase in hazard of respiratory failure (CI 95% 1.31, 2.08; p &lt;0.001), and 57% increase in hazard of being admitted to ICU (CII 95% 1.24, 1.97; p &lt;0.001).Conclusion: A history of cancer conferred poorer clinical outcomes on adult, hospitalized patients who were infected with COVID-19. Other demographic and clinical risk factors associated with cancer patients infected with COVID-19 are; older age, female sex, multiple co-morbidities, and having more respiratory symptoms and neurologic manifestations.Clinical Trial Registration Details: The study protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04386083)Funding Information: This study has not received any grant or funding from third-party organizations.Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: Our protocol was mainly endorsed by the Single Joint Research Ethics Board of the Department of Health, Philippines (SJREB-2020–24) for which the following institutions were included: Cagayan Valley Medical Center, Tuguegarao City; Jose R.

Restricting to those vaccinated with >=3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (~84% of immunocompromised and 51% of the general population), all immunocompromised groups remained at increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, with adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) for hospitalisation ranging from 1.3 to 13.1. At highest risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation were individuals with: solid organ transplant (aIRR 13.1, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 11.2-15.3), moderate to severe primary immunodeficiency (aIRR 9.7, 95% CI 6.3-14.9), stem cell transplant (aIRR 11.0, 95% CI 6.8-17.6), and recent treatment for haematological malignancy (aIRR 10.6, 95% CI 9.5-11.9).
